Chapter One – The Last Thing I Stole Was My Name

POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The bathtub was cold. I was not.

My first thought—if you could call it that—wasn’t Where am I? or Who am I?
It was, very simply:

“Oh. This again.”

No memory. No explanation. No neatly folded towel or convenient post-it note on the mirror saying “You’re Seraphina. Everything’s fine.”

Just me.

Naked. Wet. Confused. In a cracked porcelain tub stained rust-red around the drain and surrounded by symbols that looked like someone had used blood and a geometry textbook to throw a tantrum.

I sat up slowly, arms shaking. Water sloshed down my spine. Every muscle felt like it had been rung out, dried, and repurposed.

The ceiling fan creaked overhead. Buzzing light flickered against peeling paint and black mold that suspiciously resembled a demonic goat if I squinted sideways. I didn’t.

There were three men on the floor. Unconscious.

None of them were dead.

Unfortunately. I checked.

“Well. This is… dramatic,” I muttered, grabbing the nearest towel. “Ten out of ten for cult-chic ambiance. Zero for hospitality.”

I had no name. No memory. But apparently sarcasm survived soul-wipe.
Comforting.

I moved carefully—trying to avoid slipping in whatever ichor or ritual goo the previous me had clearly marinated in. A sigil on the wall sparked the second I passed it, flaring violet for half a second before vanishing.

No explosion. No scream.
Still. Felt personal.

The room wasn’t big—maybe a loft or an old break room, judging by the mismatched cabinets along the wall and the mini-fridge buzzing like it was dying of grief. A cracked mirror had been turned to face the wall.

Even it didn’t want to see me.

I hesitated. Then slowly reached up, turned it toward me.

And finally saw myself.

Pale skin—flushed now from the bath. Dark hair tangled around my face in soaked waves. Cheekbones that could slice. Mouth sharp, but not cruel. Gold-flecked eyes, bright and strange.
I looked… young. Too young to feel this heavy.

But I didn’t look harmless. Not even close.

A line of old burn scars crept up one shoulder—thin, pale, like ivy drawn in ash. My collarbones carried the memory of chains, though none were there. And the mark—

I turned. It was there. Between my shoulder blades.
Glowing faintly like a brand that hadn’t cooled yet.

The air felt colder with the mirror watching.

Still—I smiled.

“Seraphina Vale,” I said to my reflection.
“Nice to meet me.”

⸻

I found a coat tossed over a chair. Black, leather, oversized. It smelled like sage and sweat and someone else’s fight. I put it on anyway.

There was a body beneath it. One of the unconscious men. Pale, twitching.

I leaned down, curious.

He murmured something.

Sounded like “Queen.”

I stood up. Real fast.

“No, thank you,” I said. “I’ve got enough problems without a title.”

My shoulder itched again. Hot under the coat. The mark pulsed like it had its own heartbeat.

⸻

I stole a phone from one of the men. Dead battery. Figures.

The window was painted shut. The door wasn’t.

I stepped out into a stairwell that smelled like old rain and forgotten prayers, and started walking.

Down two flights. Through a door. Into a street that didn’t recognize me.

The city was alive. Neon. Cracked concrete. Sirens in the distance. The air thick with magic that didn’t know where to settle.

And me?

I was… wrong here. Not unwanted. Not invisible. But unplaceable.

The street lamps flickered when I passed. The warded sigils on a shop window sparked and hissed. A cat bolted when I looked at it.

I was a question walking without a history.
But at least I had a name now.

And if the world didn’t like it?

It could learn to kneel.
