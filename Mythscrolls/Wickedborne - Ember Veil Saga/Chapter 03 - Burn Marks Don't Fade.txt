Chapter Three – Burn Marks Don’t Fade

POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

The ink on my skin hadn’t glowed like that in seven years.

And it didn’t stop.

Even after she walked out, the sigils kept pulsing under my flesh—bright, hot, alive like they remembered something I didn’t.

I paced the corridor like a caged thing. My fists were still wrapped from the last match, but the fight was gone. Burned up in her eyes.

Who the hell was she?

No sigil should react like that. No mark should pulse in time with mine unless—
No. I wasn’t going there. Fate was a con. Destiny was a leash. I cut those a long time ago.

So why the hell couldn’t I stop replaying her voice?

“Do I look like the courier type?”

Smart mouth. No fear. She looked at me like she already knew what I could do—and didn’t flinch.

The last woman who’d looked at me like that had tried to kill me. Twice.

I’d liked her.

⸻

I peeled off my shirt and stared down at my chest in the locker room mirror. The sigils still glowed faintly—especially the ones I couldn’t remember ever getting inked.

I touched one just below my collarbone.

It pulsed.

“This doesn’t make sense,” I muttered. “None of it.”

“You talking to your chest again, or did you finally name one of your tattoos?”

I didn’t even flinch.

Jax Rook leaned against the locker frame, arms crossed, mouth already half-cocked in a grin. Hood up. Boots muddy. Eating what looked like half a cinnamon roll he’d stolen from the greenroom.

“Looks like something’s biting you. Lemme guess. Girl trouble?”

I didn’t answer.

“Oh shit, is it girl trouble?”

He stepped in, chewing louder like it helped him think.

“Tell me everything. Was she hot? I bet she was hot. Did she hit you? Please tell me she hit you. Did the sigils freak out—oh my gods, they freaked out, didn’t they?!”

“Rabbit,” I growled.

“I’m listening,” he said, mouth full of sugar and joy. “And incredibly afraid.”

“She walked in. They flared.”

“Like… flared flared?”

I nodded.

“Shit.”

He whistled low. “You think it’s a flare-match?”

“There’s no such thing,” I snapped.

“I dunno. Could be old soul link. Past life lover. Death-mark resurrection tether. Hellspawn twin—”

“Rabbit.”

“Okay okay,” he held up his hands. “But the last time your tattoos did that, you almost broke a mage in half.”

I said nothing.

“…So,” he said, grinning. “You gonna see her again?”

I turned away.

“Yeah,” Rabbit said, already pulling a flask from somewhere. “You’re totally gonna see her again.”

I stared at the mark on my chest again.

It hadn’t stopped humming.

Like something had been sleeping beneath my skin and she just… called it by name.

I didn’t know her. But something in me had. And it wouldn’t shut the fuck up about it.

“Y’know,” Rabbit’s voice said behind me, “most people just scroll through revenge porn or their ex’s vacation posts when they can’t sleep.”

I didn’t turn.

“But no,” he continued. “You? You stare at glowing tattoos and try to out-brood the moon.”

“You could knock.”

“I did. The door sighed. I took it as a yes.”

He stepped into the small gym office and tossed a bag on the table.

It smelled like fried noodles and bad decisions.

“I brought fuel,” he said. “You’ve clearly used up your quota of glaring at things for the day.”

I didn’t respond.

He sat across from me, opened the bag, and shoved a forkful in his mouth. Talked around it.

“So. Mystery girl. Still got you unhinged or did the brooding bring clarity?”

I finally looked up.

“Why do you care?”

Rabbit shrugged. “Because you don’t. And that’s the fun part.”

He leaned back in his chair, legs up.

“You shut down when shit matters. You pretend you’re in control when you’re falling apart. And now? Something’s cut through that frostbite soul of yours, and I’m here to watch the meltdown. Preferably with noodles.”

I said nothing.

“Also,” he added, “I ran her face through two image scrapers and three blackmarket scrying threads. She doesn’t exist.”

I stood up too fast.

“Nothing?” I said.

“Not even a fake identity,” Rabbit replied. “Which is impressive, since half this city doesn’t legally exist.”

That silence? The kind that rings louder than shouting? That filled the room.

“So,” Rabbit said quietly, “you think she’s like you?”

I stared at the pulsing mark under my collarbone.

“No,” I said. “She’s worse.”

Rabbit grinned.

“Good. Means you won’t be bored.”
