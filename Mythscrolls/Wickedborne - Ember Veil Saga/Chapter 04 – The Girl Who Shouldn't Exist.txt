Chapter Four – The Girl Who Shouldn’t Exist  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

It started with the smell of bread.

Not the stale, cold kind that clings to convenience stores—but the kind that feels like a memory. Warm. Fresh. A little reckless with butter.

I followed it through cracked stairwells, past metal doors that blinked like old eyes, up and up until I hit the rooftop.

And there she was.

Kneeling in a patch of rooftop garden lit by soft string lights, surrounded by tomato plants and wild herbs growing in scavenged pots. Cinnamon skin. Ink-black curls. Gold ring through one brow. Dressed like a ‘90s anime sidekick who read too many spellbooks.

She looked up. Blinked. Stared.

“I’m not giving you free weed,” she said flatly.

I blinked back. “What?”

“You followed the smell, didn’t you? Everyone does. You want snacks. Or spells. Or both.”

I glanced around the rooftop, hesitating.

“I don’t know what I want.”

That made her pause.

She stood slowly, brushing dirt off her hands. Her expression shifted from annoyance to wariness.

“You okay?”

“I’m not sure.”

“You lost?”

“…Kinda.”

She squinted. “Drunk?”

“No.”

“High?”

“No.”

“Demon-possessed?”

I almost laughed. “Maybe.”

She stared at me a second longer.

“…You don’t know who you are, do you?”

“No,” I said quietly.

And for the first time, saying it didn’t feel terrifying. Just honest.

She didn’t flinch. Didn’t mock.

Instead, she nodded toward a plastic lawn chair.

“Well, shit. Sit down. You’re either cursed, reborn, or in the middle of a magical identity crisis, and I’ve got grilled cheese.”

My feet moved before I even thought about it.

She handed me half a sandwich, still warm from the pan.

“I’m Nia,” she said simply. “Neighborhood potion dealer. Baked good alchemist. Part-time rooftop therapist.”

I hesitated. Then smiled faintly.

“…Seraphina.”

“Is that your real name?”

“It is now.”

She grinned. “Nice to meet you, Seraphina ‘Maybe Possessed’ Vale.”

I took a bite.

The grilled cheese had herbs baked right into the crust. Sharp cheddar. Something spicy and buttery and holy.

My soul didn’t just approve. It *knelt.*

I looked up at her.

And I stayed.

Later that night, I came back to the rooftop alone.

The string lights above me swayed with the wind. The city glowed with apathy. But up here… it felt like the edge of something softer.

I sat with a mug of tea Nia had shoved into my hand, staring at nothing.

My mark still pulsed, faint and steady. Like it remembered something my mind refused to catch.

Then I heard footsteps.

Not rushed. Not aggressive.

Just… there.

I turned.

And he was standing at the edge of the rooftop.

Cain.

The man from the gym. The one who looked at me like he was trying to remember how to breathe.

He didn’t say anything at first. Just stared, face unreadable.

“You followed me?” I asked.

He shook his head. “Didn’t know where I was going. Just… followed the pull.”

“So you just *show up* on rooftops at night?”

He hesitated. “City got too loud. I needed air.”

I took a sip of my tea.

He stayed near the door, like stepping closer might trigger something dangerous.

“I don’t know what you are,” he said quietly, “but when I saw you…”

“I know,” I whispered.

Because I did.

I didn’t know his name. His history. Nothing.

But something in my mark had flared the moment we locked eyes. And it was flaring again now—but slower this time. Like it *recognized* him, but didn’t want to burn for him. Not yet.

“I’m not your enemy,” he said.

“I don’t remember having any.”

That earned me a breath of a smile. Barely there.

He stepped closer, slowly.

“I’m Cain.”

“Seraphina,” I said.

He nodded.

We stood in silence under the string lights. Nothing more exchanged. Just a strange stillness between us. Like if we moved too fast, something ancient might snap.

And I didn’t want it to snap.

Not yet.
