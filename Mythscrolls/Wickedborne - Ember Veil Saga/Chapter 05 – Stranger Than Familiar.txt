Chapter Five – Stranger Than Familiar  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The city was louder the next morning.

Not with sound—but with *presence.*  
Like every shadow I passed knew me in a way I didn’t know myself.

The burn mark stayed quiet. The sigils on my arm hadn’t changed.  
But something *inside* me? Shifted.  
Like the gravity had tilted, just slightly, and now everything was sliding toward a place I couldn’t see.

⸻

I found Nia at her usual haunt—**The Charm Yard**, a crumbling magical junk shop crammed between a cursed bakery and a storefront that sold teeth. *Just teeth.*

She was half-buried behind the counter, digging through a box of broken scrying mirrors.

“Didn’t sleep again?” she asked without looking up.

“I slept. Just not all at once.”

“That’s called *blinking*, Feen.”

I tossed her a pastry. She caught it mid-air like a feral raccoon and bit into it with a triumphant growl.

Then she paused.

“You smell like blood and static. You okay?”

“I’m not bleeding.”

“Doesn’t mean you're okay.”

I sat on the edge of the counter, arms crossed. “I had a… run-in.”

“*Oooh,*” she said, eyes lighting up. “Run-in as in, sexy danger or mortal peril?”

I didn’t answer.

She raised a brow. “So. Both.”

⸻

I told her just enough.  
The glowing marks. The rooftop. Cain.  
Not the name. Not the *feeling*.

And definitely not how his voice had dug into my bones like it belonged there.

Nia listened, chewing thoughtfully.

Then she slid something across the counter.

A folded scrap of paper.

“What's this?”

“An invite,” she said. “Private market. Not the safe kind. But sometimes, the things that *don’t* want to be found show up there.”

I raised a brow. “You’re giving me something shady and magical to cheer me up?”

“Obviously,” she said. “I’m not gonna *hug* you. Gross.”

I smiled.

⸻

That night, I followed the map to a half-collapsed subway station.

There was no sign. Just a sigil burned into the tunnel wall and a girl selling cursed lollipops.

I stepped past her.

The air shimmered—and I walked into a different world.

⸻

**The underground market pulsed with impossible life.**

Crimson lanterns floated without strings, each one glowing with a different person’s stolen heartbeat.

An old man with blindfolded eyes sold whispers in glass vials—five coins to hear a secret, seven to forget one.

A tattoo artist inked spells that only worked under moonlight.

Everywhere I looked, something felt like it was *watching me back.*

Stalls hawked potion-slicked bones, false memories, time-charmed jewelry. A man with no mouth bartered in dreams. A two-headed cat slept on a cashbox full of silver and thorns.

There was a woman reading fortunes from melted candle wax.  
Another offering curses tailored to ex-lovers and political rivals—"Buy two, curse one free."

A blood-thinner fae passed me and *paused*, sniffed once, and moved on.

And somewhere in the center of it all, a slow circle had formed around a hooded vendor handing out threads of light that **screamed** when they touched air.

This wasn’t just a market. It was a place where the *edges of things unraveled.*

⸻

I was halfway down the corridor when it happened—

A tremor under my skin.  
Not pain. Not heat.  
A pulse. Familiar.

The mark on my back flared once—like it *noticed someone watching.*

I turned.

But the space behind me was empty.

—

Except for a woman in a plague mask, staring like she *knew my name.*

⸻

POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

The ink on my skin hadn’t glowed like that in seven years.

And it didn’t stop.

Even hours later—after the rooftop, after I’d walked away like some shadow trying to outrun the light—it still pulsed under my collarbone. Dim, steady. Like it was waiting.

I didn’t like it.

Didn’t like that a stranger could tilt my entire axis by *standing still.*

I paced the corridor like a caged thing. My fists were still wrapped from the last match, but the fight was gone. Burned up in her eyes. Her silence. That fucking rooftop.

Who the hell was she?

No sigil should react like that. Not for someone I didn’t know. Not twice. Not without a reason.

But every time I closed my eyes… I saw her.

Sitting under string lights. Mug in her hands. Not running. Not flinching. Just watching me like I was a riddle she already understood.

The last woman who’d looked at me like that had tried to kill me. Twice.

I’d liked her.

⸻

I peeled off my shirt and stared down at my chest in the locker room mirror. The sigils still glowed faintly—especially the ones I couldn’t remember ever getting inked.

I touched one just below my collarbone.

It pulsed.

“This doesn’t make sense,” I muttered. “None of it.”

“You talking to your chest again, or did you finally name one of your tattoos?”

I didn’t even flinch.

Jax Rook leaned against the locker frame like he’d been summoned by trouble. Hoodie half-zipped, combat boots tracking in alley mud, cinnamon roll in hand like it was a holy artifact.

People called him Rabbit.

Fast on his feet. Faster with his mouth. Fights dirty. Thinks dirtier. My informant. My idiot. My oldest almost-friend.

“Looks like something’s biting you. Lemme guess. Girl trouble?”

I didn’t answer.

“Oh shit, is it girl trouble?”

He stepped in, chewing louder like it helped him think.

“Tell me everything. Was she hot? I bet she was hot. Did she hit you? Please tell me she hit you. Did the sigils freak out—oh my gods, they freaked out, didn’t they?!”

“Rabbit,” I growled.

“I’m listening,” he said, mouth full of sugar and joy. “And incredibly afraid.”

“She showed up at the gym last week. The marks flared.”

Rabbit’s eyes widened. “Like… flared flared?”

“And tonight,” I added, quieter now, “I saw her again.”

“Where?”

“Rooftop. North side. Couldn’t sleep. My feet brought me there.”

He squinted. “You’re sleepwalking to women now? Damn, Drossel. You gotta warn a guy.”

I sat down heavily on the bench, staring at my palms.

“She didn’t do anything. Just… looked at me. Like she *knew* something I didn’t.”

Rabbit paused.

“You’re serious.”

“Dead serious.”

“…You like her.”

I shot him a glare sharp enough to skin a demon.

He grinned like he’d just found his favorite new hobby.

⸻

Later, in the gym’s small office, Rabbit tossed a bag on the table that smelled like fried noodles and poor decisions.

“You need carbs. Brooding burns calories.”

I didn’t respond.

He sat across from me, opened the bag, and shoved a forkful in his mouth. Talked around it.

“So. Mystery girl. Still got you unhinged or did the rooftop breeze clear that up?”

I looked up, slow and steady.

“Why do you care?”

Rabbit shrugged. “Because you don’t. And that’s the fun part.”

He leaned back in his chair, legs up.

“You shut down when shit matters. You pretend you’re in control when you’re falling apart. And now? Something cut through that frostbite soul of yours, and I’m here to watch the meltdown. Preferably with noodles.”

I said nothing.

“Also,” he added, “I ran her face through two image scrapers and three blackmarket scrying threads. She doesn’t exist.”

I froze.

“Nothing?” I said.

“Not even a fake identity,” Rabbit replied. “Which is impressive, since half this city doesn’t legally exist.”

That silence? The kind that rings louder than shouting? That filled the room.

“So,” Rabbit said quietly, “you think she’s like you?”

I stared at the pulsing mark under my collarbone.

“No,” I said. “She’s worse.”

Rabbit grinned.

“Good. Means you won’t be bored.”
