Chapter Six – Whispers Beneath the Mask  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

She didn’t move.

The woman in the plague mask just stood there—still, poised, like a painting waiting for me to blink first.

Crowds swirled around her, never touching. Like the market itself bent away from her edges.

The mark on my back pulsed again. Once. Twice.

She tilted her head.

“You’ve forgotten again,” she said. Her voice was soft, but it slithered through the noise like it *belonged* in my ear.

“I don’t know you.”

“You knew me,” she said. “In the life before this one. And the one before that.”

I took a step back.

The crowd didn’t notice. The lanterns flickered above me—but none dimmed near her.

She moved closer. Her coat swirled like it remembered wind no one else could feel.

“You called yourself Seraphina this time. Not the worst choice.”

“What do you mean ‘this time’?”

Her head tilted the other way, almost amused.

“They always leave that part out when they throw you back.”

“I’m not thrown,” I snapped. “I woke up. Alone.”

A pause.

Then, she whispered:  
**“And yet you still burn, don’t you?”**

I flinched.

The sigils on my arms didn’t glow—but they *wanted* to.

“Why are you watching me?” I demanded.

“To see if you’d survive the market,” she replied. “Most who come through don’t leave untouched.”

“Am I touched now?”

“Oh, love,” she said. “You were *never* untouched.”

She reached out and placed something cold in my hand.

It was a coin. Bone-white. Carved with symbols I couldn’t read—but my skin *recognized* them. Like the shape of a lullaby I hadn’t heard since I was fire and soul and ash.

“If you want answers,” she said, “don’t ask the men who marked you.”

My breath caught.

“They’re not the ones who made you.”

And then she turned.  
Walked past two cursed sword vendors.  
Vanished into smoke and noise and a single crimson lantern that flickered out when she passed.

⸻

I stood in the middle of the market, fists clenched, heart unsteady.

The coin in my palm was warm now.

Not from my hand.

From the *name* it remembered.

And that name?

Wasn’t Seraphina.

⸻

I left the market at dawn. The sigil door closed behind me like it had never existed.

The city was quiet again. Normal.

But I wasn’t.

The coin pulsed in my pocket.

And for the first time since waking up, I didn’t feel like I was building a new life.

I felt like I was being *hunted by the last one.*
