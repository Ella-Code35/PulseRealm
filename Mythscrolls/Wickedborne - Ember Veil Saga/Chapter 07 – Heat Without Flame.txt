Chapter Seven – Heat Without Flame  
POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

I woke up angry.

No reason. Just that slow, thick kind of rage that simmers under the skin.

The sigils on my chest hadn’t glowed in hours—but I could feel them.  
Like a heartbeat out of sync.  
Like something under my ribs trying to claw out.

I’d felt this before.  
A long time ago.

And it ended in blood.

⸻

The gym was still dark when I arrived.

Rabbit was already there, hanging upside down from the punching bag chains like a chaos-bat with opinions.

“Morning, sunshine,” he said, not bothering to turn right side up. “You look like wrath incarnate.”

“Training.”

“Orrrrr,” he said, flipping off the chain, “you could tell me what’s lighting up your soul tattoos again.”

“They’re not lighting.”

“Then why is the thermostat cracking?”

I looked down.

The metal around the thermostat was warping. Not melting. *Bending.*

I hadn’t touched it.

⸻

Rabbit threw me a towel like it was armor.

“Okay, so. Your freaky marks are reacting again. Coincidence?”

I ignored him.

He kept talking. “Or maybe Miss I-Don’t-Have-A-Name is poking around places she shouldn’t.”

My head snapped up. “You’ve been tracking her?”

“Technically? No. Morally? Probably.”

He pulled a cracked phone from his hoodie.

“Security cam flagged her sigil in one of the underground nodes. Night market. That’s the realm where curses go to breed, by the way.”

“Why was she there?”

“Dunno. But she left with something.”

He tossed me a still from the feed.

Grainy. Pixelated.  
But I could see her face.  
Not scared. Not lost.

*Determined.*

She was becoming someone again.

And I didn’t know if that meant I needed to get closer—

—or walk the hell away before she lit me up from the inside.

⸻

I trained hard that morning. Hard enough to bleed.

But the sigils still pulsed.

And by the end of the hour, one of them had *changed.*

Not glowing.  
Not burning.

Just… rearranged.  
A single mark on my chest—now curved into something that looked almost like a **name.**

I stared at it in the locker room mirror.

Rabbit hovered behind me.

“You think she did that?”

“I don’t think,” I muttered.

“Maybe you should.”

I didn’t answer.

Because deep down, I knew something had started.

And for the first time in seven years—

I didn’t feel free.

I felt **called.**
