Chapter Eight – The Door That Shouldn’t Open  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I should’ve thrown the coin away.

Burned it. Lost it. Buried it under something normal like rent bills or breakfast cereal.

Instead, I kept it in my coat pocket like it *belonged there.*

Which made no sense.  
I didn’t even know what it *was.*  
But every time I tried to forget about it, I got this weird, twitchy feeling in my shoulder blades—like the damn thing was glaring at me.

“Okay, creepy ghost coin. Fine. Lead the way,” I muttered. “Let’s go get possessed. Again.”

It pulsed harder.

Because of course it did.

⸻

The city shifted the farther I went.

Fewer people. Stranger buildings. Streetlights that flickered in deliberate rhythms.  
Signs written in languages I didn’t know but *understood* in that bone-deep, this-isn’t-normal kind of way.

And every turn I took felt guided. Like someone was gently steering me with invisible hands.

Not a shove. Not even a pull.

A *nudge.*

I hate being nudged. It feels like fate with commitment issues.

Still, I kept walking.

Because whatever was waiting at the end of this path?  
I think it already knew I wouldn’t turn back.

⸻

I stopped in front of a narrow alley lined with shattered stone and a door with no handle.

Just a mark.

The **same** one that burned between my shoulder blades.

It glowed faintly, as if recognizing me first.

I didn’t touch it.

I just *exhaled.*

And the door opened—silent, smooth, like it had been waiting for me to come home.

I froze.

“Okay… creepy. Very cult-vibes. Definitely a little murder-y.”

But I stepped inside anyway.

Because apparently, I’ve decided curiosity is worth dying for.

⸻

Inside was silence.

Not the peaceful kind.  
The *horrifying, your-ears-shouldn't-work-like-this* kind.

No footsteps. No breath. No sound at all.

Just a stillness so thick it felt sentient.

Candles lined the walls—unlit—but the air shimmered like they were burning just in a layer of reality I couldn’t quite reach.

At the center was a well.

But not a well.  
Not water. Not stone.

Just a void.

**Black. Bottomless. Alive.**

I took a step back.

Nope.  
No thank you.  
Why is it breathing?

It wasn’t, technically. But it felt like it *could.*

Like it wanted to.

And worst of all, it *recognized me.*

I stepped closer. Slowly.

My fingers hovered over the edge, not touching.

And that’s when I felt it.

Something in there… *saw me.*

And it whispered:

**“Come home.”**

I flinched.

“Nope nope nope. You don’t get to say that to a girl who’s already dealing with magical amnesia.”

⸻

I backed away fast, knocking into a shelf.

Books spilled across the floor.

One landed open.

Pages flipped. Stopped. Revealed a name.

**Mine.**

But not *Seraphina.*

I stared at the letters, and something behind my ribs cracked open like old stone shifting.

Tears hit my eyes before I even knew why.

I touched the page—and the world exploded.

⸻

Fire.  
Chains.  
A blade carving into glowing flesh.  
A man screaming a name as I disappeared in a burst of ash.

Not Cain.  
Not Rabbit.

Someone else.

Someone I *should* remember.

⸻

I came to outside the door.

Except now there *wasn’t* a door.

No alley. No candles. No well.

Just the street.

And silence.

The coin was gone.

But the name?

Still there.

Burned behind my eyes. Etched into the edges of my magic.

**And the mark on my back had changed.**
