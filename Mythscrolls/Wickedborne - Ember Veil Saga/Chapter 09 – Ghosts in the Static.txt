Chapter Nine – Ghosts in the Static  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I didn’t remember walking home.

One minute I was blinking at a street that used to be a door.  
The next, I was standing in front of Nia’s apartment building with a hand full of tremors and a head full of noise.

The name was still there.  
Pressed into the back of my skull like a bruise I couldn’t see.

And my mark?  
Different.  
Sharper.  
More *awake.*

⸻

Nia opened the door before I knocked.

She took one look at me and pulled me inside by the collar.

“You smell like void magic,” she said.

“I smell like what now?”

She closed the door behind me with a soft click and crossed her arms.

“Sit,” she ordered.

“Wow. You didn’t even offer tea first.”

“I’ve seen possessed squirrels more stable than you right now.”

I dropped onto the couch, burying my face in my hands.

“I didn’t *do* anything.”

“Bullshit. You’ve got soul sweat.”

“That’s not a thing.”

“It is when you’ve brushed up against deep magic and look like your bones still remember screaming.”

I laughed. It came out brittle.

⸻

She tossed me a blanket. The one with the little stitched foxes.

I blinked down at it, and my voice went suspiciously high-pitched.

“Oh. My favorite one. You *do* love me.”

“You wanna talk about it?” Nia said dryly.

“Not really,” I said, already pulling the blanket to my chin like a five-year-old hiding from bedtime monsters.

She gave me a long, practiced stare and rolled her eyes.

“You only do that when you’re dodging something.”

I blinked innocently over the edge of the fox blanket.

“Seraphina,” she said flatly, “your cute act doesn’t work on me. I invented it.”

I let the blanket drop just enough to smirk. “Worth a shot.”

“You look like a feral raccoon in a duvet.”

“I feel like one.”

“Talk.”

I sighed, curling up but letting the act fade. She’d pierced through it anyway.

⸻

She sat across from me, fingers steepled.

“You wanna start at the top, or should I guess based on how cursed your aura looks?”

“There was a door.”

“Okay,” she said slowly.

“I didn’t open it. It opened for me. Like it knew me.”

Her silence gave me permission to keep going.

“There was… a well. But not. Just darkness. Living darkness. And a book. With a name. Mine, I think. But not mine.”

Nia sat straighter, her brows pinching.

“Did you say anything?”

“I didn’t have to. It already knew me.”

“Seraphina—”

“And it called me *home.*”

That stopped her.

I didn’t cry. Not this time. But my voice cracked when I whispered the last part.

“And I think I believed it.”

⸻

The room fell into that kind of silence that only happens after truth.

Nia reached out and pressed her palm against my back.

She hissed.

“What?”

“Your mark—it’s different.”

“No shit.”

“No, I mean it’s *woken.* It’s not just reacting. It’s... whispering.”

I turned to her.

She looked pale. Like she recognized something.

“I’ve only felt something like this once,” she said softly. “And the girl it happened to? She didn’t stay herself.”

I swallowed.

“Did she die?”

Nia shook her head. “Worse. She remembered too much.”

⸻

I didn’t sleep that night.

The name echoed in my chest.

The mark burned quietly under my skin.

And in the dark, something shifted again.

Only this time, it wasn’t inside me.

It was *outside.*

Someone else had felt it.

Someone I hadn’t met yet—

But they were already moving.
