Chapter Ten – The Alchemist’s Eye  
POV: Ezra Lorne

⸻

The compound had gone still before the pulse hit.

Ezra Lorne paused, a vial of something volatile halfway to crystallization.

He didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe.

Just watched the elixir ripple in its vial—slight, subtle.  
But magic that old didn’t move without reason.

He placed the vial down carefully and closed his eyes.

There it was again.

A thread pulled taut.

A call he hadn’t felt in *centuries.*

⸻

He moved through the upper levels like smoke. Silent. Precision-laced.

The wards were quiet.  
No breach.  
No intrusion.

But the magic had shifted.  
And his mark—hidden beneath layers of skin and ink—was *itching.*

A part of him he’d sealed away for his own safety…  
was awake.

Ezra descended into his private archives and pulled open a locked drawer.

Inside was a ledger.

Not of debts.  
Of losses.

He flipped to a page he hadn’t touched since the world fell quiet.

There, etched in fading ink, was a name he never dared speak aloud.

It stared back at him.

Familiar. Impossible.

Alive.

⸻

“She’s returned,” he said, voice quiet.

Not shocked. Not fearful.

Just… resolved.

He turned toward the ward mirror. It shimmered, hesitating, then pulled an image into its surface.

A girl.

Black hair tangled from wind. Boots scuffed. Magic not yet hers coiled around her like smoke waiting to be shaped.

She stood in front of a bookstore, arguing with someone—fierce, funny, unknowingly divine.

Ezra stared.

“Of all the forms to wear, little flame…”

He reached up, fingers grazing his collarbone.

The mark beneath it burned faintly.

“Do you remember me?”

She laughed at something offscreen.

He watched the curve of her mouth. The heat behind her eyes.

“No,” he said to himself. “You don’t.”

He pressed a hand to the mirror’s edge.

“But I remember *you.*”

⸻

Ezra didn’t move right away.

He wasn’t Cain. He didn’t rush the storm.

He studied it.

Plotted its spiral.

Predicted its destruction.

And this one—this *girl* with a void-tainted name and forgotten divinity—would break the world open again.

He would not try to stop her.

But he would not let her burn alone this time.

He whispered a word to the mirror.

It shimmered again—rewinding, recalibrating.

“Find her,” he said softly.

“And let her find me.”
