Chapter Eleven – Coffee, Chaos, and a Stranger’s Smile  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

There are days when the world pretends it’s normal.

Sun. Sky. Baristas with way too much emotional power.  
And me—pretending I’m not walking around with a sentient tattoo and magical PTSD.

I was doing so well too.

Until I walked into Hallowed Grounds and felt the magic shift again.

⸻

Nia waved at me from the back, already halfway through her second espresso and absolutely judging the slow demise of a nearby muffin.

I grabbed mine at the counter—something with cinnamon and just enough caffeine to make my ancestors nervous—and slid into the booth across from her.

“You look haunted,” she said cheerfully.

I sipped.

She narrowed her eyes. “You had another mark-flare, didn’t you?”

“Maybe.”

“Where?”

“Here.”

She blinked. “The coffee shop?”

“It pulsed the second I walked in. Not full on glow-fest. Just… a hum.”

She looked around sharply.

“Don’t.”

“What?”

“You’re doing that thing where your eyes go full witch-detective.”

“I *am* a witch.”

“You’re also very bad at subtlety.”

She rolled her eyes, leaned back, and muttered, “Well, I don’t sense anything actively cursed…”

“I do.”

She paused. “Really?”

“It’s faint. But it’s not *me* this time.”

That got her attention.

⸻

The hum wasn’t random.

It tugged.

Not like the coin. Not like the door.

This was *gentler.*  
More curious than commanding.

And it wasn’t leading me anywhere this time.  
It was… approaching.

I caught the moment it happened.

The bell above the café door jingled. I didn’t look. I *felt.*

The magic in my mark flickered.

I sipped my drink to hide the jolt that ran through me.

Nia glanced over casually and her breath hitched—just a fraction.

“Don’t panic,” she said.

“Why would I panic?”

“Because he looks like a cursed librarian and he's staring at you like you burned down his favorite mythology scroll.”

I choked.

Full-on, actual *spit-take.*

Cinnamon foam went flying across the table.

Nia blinked. “Wow.”

“I wasn’t ready!” I hissed, wiping my mouth with the sleeve of shame.

“I noticed.”

I turned, trying to play it cool.

Big mistake.

Because my gaze collided with **him.**

⸻

And of course—of *course*—he saw the whole thing.

Elegant. Composed. The kind of man who probably read grimoires in multiple languages and had never once in his life spit a beverage across a table.

And me?

I was still blotting chai off my chin.

He didn’t look amused.

He looked… intrigued.

I turned back around so fast I nearly headbutted my own latte.

“Kill me,” I muttered into the lid.

“No time,” Nia said. “You have a new admirer.”

“I choked.”

“And yet he’s still looking.”

“This is a disaster.”

“This is *delightful*.”

I groaned, hiding behind my cup again.

“Do you *know* him?” she asked.

“No.”

“You sure?”

“…I don’t think so.”

“But he knows you.”

I peeked over my cup, cheeks still flushed.

And damn it, he *was* still looking.

Not creepy. Not invasive. Just… focused. Like I was a puzzle he already owned the missing piece to.

I sank lower in my seat.

“I need a time-turner and new dignity.”

“You need a nap and possibly a magical restraining order.”

“I’m never showing my face in here again.”

Nia grinned. “Then at least go down in flames.”

“Story of my life.”
