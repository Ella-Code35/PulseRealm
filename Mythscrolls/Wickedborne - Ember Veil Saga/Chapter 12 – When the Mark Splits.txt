Chapter Twelve – When the Mark Splits  
POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

I felt it before it happened.

The mark over my heart flared—sharp and sudden, like teeth clamping down on a live wire. I doubled over in the middle of the gym’s upstairs office, hand clutching at the ink beneath my skin.

“Again?” Rabbit said from behind me, chewing something suspicious and crunchy. “That your magic bat signal or did someone hex your nipples?”

I didn’t respond.

Couldn’t.

The pulse was wrong.

Not like before.

Different.

*Divided.*

It used to feel like heat pulling in one direction—toward her.

But now?

It had *split.*

Another pull. Lighter. Cooler. But just as real.

As if the bond had frayed at the edge and tethered itself elsewhere.

I straightened, jaw clenched, staring into the wall like it owed me answers.

“No,” I muttered.

Rabbit raised an eyebrow, flopped into the chair opposite me, and tossed a bag of pretzels on the desk.

“So what’s the glowy rage today? Your sigil flare again?”

“It moved.”

“Moved?”

“Like it shifted. Pulled.”

Rabbit blinked. “You mean like… another flare?”

I shook my head.

“Like it *found someone else.*”

⸻

Rabbit stilled.

Now *that* got through his sugar-fueled sarcasm.

“You think she’s tethered to more than just you?”

“I don’t think anything,” I said, pacing. “But the magic doesn’t lie.”

“So what—there’s another mark reacting somewhere?”

“Feels like it.”

I stopped pacing.

The air felt *off.* Too thin. Too quiet.

“She’s not mine.”

Rabbit made a face. “Okay, brooding Batman. Chill.”

“I mean it,” I snapped. “She’s not mine. The bond? It’s not exclusive. I felt it open. Felt it... split.”

Rabbit was quiet a moment, then whistled.

“You jealous?”

“No.”

“You sound jealous.”

“I’m not.”

Rabbit leaned back in his chair, grinning like a lunatic.

“Because if you *were*, I’d say: good. Means you give a shit.”

I glared.

He kept grinning.

“I’d also say you should tell her before someone else figures it out first.”

I folded my arms. “I’m not telling her anything until I know what this is.”

“She might already know.”

“No. She wouldn’t.”

Rabbit raised an eyebrow. “Wanna bet?”

The silence stretched.

And in that silence, the tether pulsed again.

Lighter. Quieter.

Pulling me farther from the fire I thought was mine alone.

⸻

I sat.

Pressed a hand flat to the mark on my chest.

It was still glowing—faint and steady like a heartbeat not my own.

“She’s changing,” I said, mostly to myself.

“Yeah,” Rabbit said. “But maybe… so are you.”

I didn’t answer.

Because the worst part wasn’t that I might lose her—

It was that I never had her to begin with.
