Chapter Thirteen – Ink and Echoes  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The dreams started that night.

Not nightmares.

Just… out-of-place memories.

I was walking through a garden that didn’t exist. Touching roses that hummed in languages I didn’t understand. And in the distance, I saw a man made of ink and starlight, waiting for me beside a door that hadn’t been built yet.

I didn’t know him.

But something inside me *ached* like I had once carved his name into my ribs.

⸻

I woke up with the word “Ezra” burned onto my tongue.

No idea where it came from.  
But it didn’t leave.

It followed me into the morning.

Into Nia’s kitchen.

Into the clatter of pans and a smell that could turn demons holy.

“What are you making?” I mumbled, hair a mess, soul even messier.

“Magic,” Nia said, handing me a bowl. “Also known as breakfast.”

I sat down at the table, grateful. Still dazed.

She glanced at me.

“You dreamed again, didn’t you?”

“I think so. But it didn’t feel like a dream. It felt… planted.”

She didn’t ask for details. Just set down two plates. One with pancakes, the other with—

“Oh my gods, those are your famous glazed wings.”

Nia smiled.

“I thought you said this was breakfast.”

“Don’t limit me.”

I took a bite. Moaned.

“Okay. You win,” I said, chewing. “This is magic.”

“Better,” she said, smirking.

⸻

I looked up and caught her watching me.

Not with worry.

With… recognition.

“You’ve been different,” she said softly. “Since the flare.”

“I feel like I’m… wearing someone else’s skin.”

“Does it fit?”

“Too well,” I whispered.

⸻

A silence fell over the table—not heavy. Just full.

The kind you sit inside when you don’t have the right words yet, so you pass the syrup instead.

I reached for another wing.

Nia swatted my hand.

“That’s *my* plate.”

“Food is love.”

“Then love me from afar.”

And that—somehow—made me laugh.

Not the fake kind. Not the polite kind.

The *real* kind.

The kind that cracked the ice behind my ribs and let air rush in.

Nia blinked.

“Did you just… laugh at a joke?”

“Don’t make it weird.”

She grinned.

“I’m making it a national holiday.”

⸻

But beneath it—faint, almost soft—

That tether tugged again.

My mark hummed, low and steady.

And outside, a figure leaned against a café window, watching my reflection through the glass.

He didn’t move.

But I *felt* him smile.

And somewhere inside me?

Something smiled back.
