Chapter Fourteen – The Alchemist’s Trace  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I didn’t plan to go to the bookstore.

I was walking. That was all. Trying to shake off a dream I didn’t remember and a name I hadn’t said aloud.

Ezra.

I wasn’t even sure it *was* a name.

But it echoed like one.

And it felt like mine.

⸻

The shop was old. Cramped. Tucked between a tarot café and a laundromat that might’ve been a front for demon laundering. I’d walked this street before. Never noticed it.

But today?

The door was open.

The air inside smelled like dust and spellwork. Old ink and forgotten stories. The kind of place where silence *watched* you, waiting to see what you’d touch.

I moved through the narrow aisles slowly.

Books pressed close on both sides. Tall shelves. No music. Just the soft hum of something breathing between the pages.

I should’ve left.

But my mark itched.

And then… I saw the book.

Not on a shelf.

On a table.

Open.

Waiting.

⸻

It was a slim, leatherbound thing—no title on the spine, just a sunburst etched into the cover.

I reached for it.

The moment I touched the page, the tether flared. My breath hitched. My vision blurred.

And there—scrawled across the margin in ink that hadn’t dried—

**“This isn’t the first time you’ve found me.”**

The handwriting was mine.

I stepped back. Nearly dropped the book.

No one else moved.

No footsteps.

No laughter.

Just the book. And the page. And that line that felt like a hook sunk deep into the back of my ribs.

⸻

“Can I help you?”

The voice was soft. Old.

I looked up and saw a woman behind the counter—gray-haired, thick glasses, knitting what looked like a sweater for a cat.

I swallowed. “Who else has handled this?”

She blinked. “No one. That table hasn’t been touched in weeks. You’re the first.”

I stared at the page again.

Still fresh.

Still in my handwriting.

Still *impossible.*

I closed the book. Set it down.

The old woman smiled faintly.

“I’ve seen people find answers here,” she said. “And sometimes… they find *promises.*”

I didn’t reply.

Because outside—beyond the window—a man was walking away.

Black coat. Measured steps. Back to me.

I only caught a glimpse of his profile before he turned the corner.

But it was enough.

The mark on my chest pulsed.

Just once.

But it was enough.
