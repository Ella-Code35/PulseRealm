Chapter Fifteen – The Taste of Something Missing  
POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

I couldn’t find her.

Not in the places we crossed.  
Not in the parts of the city where my mark used to hum the loudest.

And the silence?  
It wasn’t empty.

It was *evasive.*

The kind you only hear when someone’s pulling away.

⸻

I slammed my fists into the training bag, over and over, letting the sound fill the void. The gym was empty, save for the echo of breath and leather. And my thoughts.

They were loud.

Louder than the pain in my arms. Louder than the sigil that hadn’t glowed in days.

It used to pulse when she was close.  
Now?

Now it barely flickered.

Like the tether was *waiting.*

Or worse—*redirecting.*

⸻

She was slipping.

And the thing inside me—the part I kept buried, the part I locked behind blood and ink—it *noticed.*

It didn’t like it.

It snarled every time I thought of her walking away.

Of her *looking* at someone else the way she’d looked at me.

That sharp mouth. That reckless defiance. That… **recognition.**

No one else should get that.

No one else should *earn it.*

⸻

The door creaked open mid-punch.

I didn’t turn.

“You look like you’re trying to commit murder by exercise,” Rabbit said.

“I’m busy.”

“I brought beer.”

“You’re not funny.”

“I also brought… this.”

A container landed near the bench. I glanced at it. Recognized the handwriting on the label.

It was hers.

Seraphina had left it the night before. No explanation. Just a short note that said *“Eat or don’t.”*

I’d done both. Stared at it, then ate it anyway.

There was still half left.

Rabbit had clearly found it.

I didn’t remember offering.

“Is this who I think it is?” he asked, peeling back the lid like it held divine secrets.

“Don’t.”

He took a bite. Froze. Blinked.

“Oh,” he whispered. “Oh gods.”

I glared at him.

“This isn’t food. This is foreplay.”

I said nothing.

He chewed slower, reverent.

“Who is she?”

“You know who she is.”

“No, no—I *know* who she is, but who is she? This? This isn’t normal cooking. This is—this is *ancestral memory triggering.* This is soul magic in sauce form.”

He took another bite.

“I think I’m in love.”

“You’re not.”

“Okay, fine, but I’m very interested in her spice ratios.”

He licked a bit off his thumb like he’d been touched by holy flame.

“Do you think she’d—like—give me a recipe? Or let me watch her cook? Not in a weird way. In a totally normal, *barely stalker-y* way.”

“Rabbit.”

“Just hypothetically. What’s her last name again? Does she have a familiar? Is she single? Wait—is she the one that lives with the other girl, the one with the—”

“You’re spiraling.”

“I *need context.*”

“You need to stop eating my food.”

“I need to know her birthday.”

⸻

He flopped onto the bench beside the weight rack, swinging his leg like he had nervous energy to burn.

Then he looked at the container again—softly, like it had hurt him and kissed him in the same breath.

“You ever eat something and feel like it’s the beginning of a prophecy?”

I stared at him.

He took another bite.

“…Just me then?”

⸻

My mark flared. Briefly.

Then dimmed again.

Still there.

Still *hers.*

But not pulsing for *me.*

Not like before.

Just… listening.

For someone else’s voice.
