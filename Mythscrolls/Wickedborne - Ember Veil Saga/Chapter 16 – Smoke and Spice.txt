Chapter Sixteen – Smoke and Spice  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The kitchen smelled like comfort and memory.

Nia had gone *feral* with spices again—some fiery blend that made the air feel charged, like magic trying to crawl into my throat and dance on my taste buds.

I stood by the open window, nursing a glass of something too hot to drink and too comforting to put down. Watching the street below like I expected it to whisper secrets.

But my chest felt tight. My mark… wrong.

Not painful.

Just *waiting.*

Like it was trying to hold its breath.

⸻

Nia stirred the pan with practiced chaos, mumbling curses at the sauce like it had insulted her lineage.

“If this batch doesn’t turn out right, I’m throwing the stove out the window.”

“Violence as therapy?”

“It’s cheaper than therapy,” she muttered, tasting the spoon and nodding to herself. “Better, too.”

I smiled faintly. But inside? My nerves were wired like a live fuse.

The mark on my chest had stopped flickering. Not cold—but *poised*. Like it knew something I didn’t.

⸻

Then the doorbell rang.

Twice. Then three sharp knocks.

I glanced at Nia. “You expecting anyone?”

She shook her head, already wiping her hands on a towel. “Nope. But if it’s someone selling solar panels again, I *swear—*”

“I’ll get it,” I said, heading for the door.

⸻

Cain stood on the other side.

His eyes locked onto mine like he'd seen a ghost he’d been hunting.

“Seraphina?” he breathed.

His shock wasn’t faked. He looked genuinely rattled—like his world had just tilted thirty degrees to the left.

He wasn’t alone.

There was another man beside him—lean, sharp-eyed, and already sniffing the air like a bloodhound high on cinnamon.

The moment he caught a stronger whiff, he stepped forward past Cain and pointed dramatically into the apartment.

“*That.* That right there.”

I blinked.

He looked at me, then past me, then back again—his eyes wild with purpose.

“Two of you,” he muttered. “Which one of you is the culinary sorceress who made the honey-glazed chicken with the spice blend that could incite international conflict?”

Cain muttered, “Rabbit—”

“*Which one?*” the stranger asked again, eyes ping-ponging between us.

Nia appeared beside me, arching a slow eyebrow.

He froze.

Stared.

His breath hitched like someone had punched him in the ribs—with beauty, not violence.

“Oh,” he whispered. “It’s you.”

Nia blinked. “Me?”

“You’re the one,” he said, stepping closer like she was a sunrise and he was a moth in rehab. “I tasted your food once and now I’m pretty sure I’d change religions for you. Not just the seasoning. The balance. The confidence. The *unapologetic garlic.*”

“Do you always hit on people via spice analysis?” Nia asked flatly.

Rabbit didn’t even flinch. “Only when it’s working.”

Cain groaned. “We were *just walking,* and this lunatic started sniffing the wind like a cursed fairyhound. Dragged me across five blocks because he swore someone was making magic.”

“I was *right,*” Rabbit said without shame. “Tell me your name so I can carve it into the back of my tongue.”

Nia deadpanned. “It's *No.*”

“I love it.”

⸻

Cain turned to me again, the noise around us dimming in his silence.

“I didn’t know it was you,” he said softly. “I was just following him. He wouldn’t stop.”

I nodded slowly, heart thumping too loud.

“I didn’t expect you either.”

He looked like he wanted to say something more, but the words caught in his throat.

And then my mark pulsed again—just once.

His eyes flicked to my collarbone like he felt it too.

⸻

Rabbit was still locked on Nia.

“Okay, but real talk: do you cook every day? Is there a subscription? A mailing list? A trial hex I can survive?”

Nia folded her arms. “If you touch anything in my kitchen, you will not survive.”

He grinned, utterly undeterred. “See, I *like* her.”

I laughed. Loud and honest.

And when I looked at Cain again, he was watching me like he’d missed that sound more than he should admit.
