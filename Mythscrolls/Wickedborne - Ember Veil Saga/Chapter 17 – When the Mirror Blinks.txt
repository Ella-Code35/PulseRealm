Chapter Seventeen – When the Mirror Blinks  
POV: Ezra Varnen

⸻

The ward trembled.

Just once—like something deep in its bones had been nudged by a force it didn’t recognize.

Ezra didn’t look up right away. He was busy not blinking.

Not breathing.

The mirror in front of him had gone still, but not *quiet.* The magic inside it swirled like smoke inside a snow globe—trapped, aware, and slightly pissed off.

He stared into it the way one might stare into a lake full of teeth.

Then, as if something invisible clicked into place, the reflection *blinked.*

Ezra did not.

⸻

The magic around him recoiled. The candles flickered. The silence thickened.

He stood slowly, adjusting the sleeve of his long black coat, and walked across the rune-ringed floor like gravity couldn’t touch him.

The spell circle was still active.

But it had changed.

One rune near the edge—subtle, half-erased—had reformed itself. Like it remembered something.

Something ancient.

Something buried.

He stared at it like he recognized the echo. But his expression didn’t flicker.

Not even when the temperature dropped two degrees around him.

⸻

Footsteps echoed in the outer hallway.

“Ezra?”

A voice he tolerated.

Violet.

Apprentice magus. Specialist in mirror magic and ceremonial wards. Loyal to the Conclave, but far too curious for their comfort.

She stepped into the chamber like she belonged there. She didn’t. No one did.

But he allowed her.

Maybe because she asked the right questions. Maybe because she never pretended he was warm.

Maybe because she didn’t flinch.

Violet was half-covered in ink and starlight, her dark hair twisted into a braid that shimmered faintly with binding glyphs. Her bracelets jangled as she leaned against the doorframe.

“Are you summoning again?” she asked, cocking her head. “You know what the Conclave said about—”

“It wasn’t me,” Ezra said.

Violet blinked. “Oh.”

Then, slowly: “So… what are we looking at?”

She stepped closer.

As she passed him, her hand almost brushed his.

He shifted away.

Not abruptly. Not rudely.

Just enough to keep the distance.

Her gaze flicked toward his—surprised for half a heartbeat.

But he didn’t meet her eyes.

He never did.

Because lately—every time someone reached out, something in him recoiled.

Except...

Except for the phantom warmth he couldn’t explain.  
The one he dreamed of.  
The one that came with *her.*

He didn’t understand it.  
But his body did.

⸻

Violet cleared her throat, stepping past the rune circle and tilting her head.

“What does it mean?”

Ezra’s voice came low. Precise.

“It means something old just whispered back.”

⸻

He turned to the large window facing the city skyline.

Somewhere out there, the tether had moved.

*She* had moved.

And now the marks on his ribs—burned into him by rituals he never spoke of—were itching beneath his skin like they wanted to tear free.

He closed his eyes for a moment.

When he opened them, they glowed faintly.

Moonlight caught on his cheekbone, but didn’t warm it.

Nothing ever did.
