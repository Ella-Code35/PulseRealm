Chapter 18 – A Name Beneath My Skin  
POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

She laughed. Soft. Uncertain. And when I looked up, it hit me like a punch to the chest.

That sound.

Gods.

I’d forgotten what that did to me.

Not her laugh. *That* laugh. Like a memory trying to crawl back from the dead.

And when she looked at me—really looked—I almost forgot how to breathe.

She tilted her head. “You’re staring.”

“You laughed,” I said.

“Was I not supposed to?”

“No, I just… missed it.”

Her brow lifted, teasing. “Have we met before, Mr. Drossel?”

I should’ve lied. Should’ve laughed it off. But I couldn’t.

“I don’t know,” I said. “But something in me thinks we did.”

⸻

She looked away first.

Tension curled between us—unspoken, ancient, and impossible. The kind that didn’t need names or history to burn.

But she didn’t run.

Not this time.

Instead, she slid her cup closer to the edge of the table and traced her finger along its rim.

“I don’t remember anything before waking up in a cursed bathroom,” she said quietly. “But I keep getting flashes. Feelings. Like I’m supposed to know something.”

I sat down opposite her. “And does your gut usually speak in riddles?”

“It’s more of a sarcastic voice in my head,” she said. “But yes.”

That made me smile.

And that made her freeze for a second. Just one heartbeat of wide-eyed surprise—like she didn’t expect me to be *capable* of that.

⸻

“I want to help you,” I said.

She blinked. “Why?”

Because my marks glowed when you were near.  
Because something inside me remembered your name before I heard it.  
Because you’re a storm I already know how to survive.

“Because I think you’re in more danger than you realize.”

She didn’t argue.

She just nodded slowly. “That makes two of us.”

POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I didn’t know why I trusted him.

Not really.

But there was something in his voice—a kind of gravelled sincerity that felt too heavy to fake.

He wasn’t charming. He wasn’t trying to impress me.

He just looked like he wanted to understand something he didn’t have a name for.

Same as me.

“I need answers,” I said. “Real ones.”

“Then we’ll find them,” he said. No hesitation.

I should’ve questioned it more. Asked why he was so quick to throw his weight behind a girl with no past and a mark she couldn’t explain.

But I didn’t.

Instead, I let the silence stretch between us like a promise.

⸻

Nia returned with a tray of food that smelled like heaven and chaos.

She raised a brow at the awkward stillness.

“Did I miss a murder? Or is this the brooding phase of your date?”

Cain glared. I snorted.

Nia just slid the tray between us. “Eat. You’ll need your strength.”

“For what?” I asked.

“Second market,” she said. “Tonight.”

Cain sat straighter. “That’s not a good idea.”

“It’s the only idea,” Nia said. “You want answers? That’s where they’re sold.”

I didn’t like the sound of that.

But I liked being powerless even less.

I looked at Cain.

He didn’t say anything.

But he nodded once. Sharp. Final.

Like he’d already decided he wasn’t letting me go alone.

And I hated how much I wanted that.
