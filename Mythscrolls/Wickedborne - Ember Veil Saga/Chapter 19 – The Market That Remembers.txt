Chapter 19 – The Market That Remembers  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The second market wasn’t hidden in a tunnel or a half-collapsed subway station.  

It was *above* the city.  

Inside the glass skeleton of an abandoned skyscraper, cloaked from mortal eyes by veils of enchanted fog and twisted perception spells.  

To most, it looked like scaffolding and shadow.  
But the moment I stepped through the rusted service entrance, the world *shifted.*

The hallway curved in ways it shouldn’t.  
Ceiling tiles pulsed with faint sigils.  
The air smelled like burnt sugar and moonlight—and something older. Something watching.

I gripped the invitation in my pocket tighter.

Behind me, Cain followed in silence.  
Nia had stayed behind. “Too much heat,” she said. “And too many old debts I’d rather not stir.”  
I didn’t press. She’d given me the way in. That was enough.

Up ahead, the stairwell flickered with unnatural light.

I climbed.

And the deeper I went, the louder the market became—**not with sound, but sensation.**  
Memories that weren’t mine brushed my skin. Emotions licked the edge of my awareness like hungry wind.  

By the time we reached the top floor, my pulse was stuttering in rhythms I didn’t recognize as my own.

⸻

The glassless windows revealed a skyline warped with magic—city lights pulsing like veins across a sleeping beast’s back.

And the market?

It was chaos wrapped in silk.

Stalls built from bones and velvet. Trinkets that whispered when touched. Sellers with teeth too sharp and smiles too wide.  
No neon signs here—just glowing glyphs that *sang* to the desperate and brave.

Cain moved closer, his arm brushing mine.

“You okay?” he murmured.

“No,” I said. “But that seems like the right state of mind for a place like this.”

His mouth twitched.

Not a smile. But almost.

⸻

A woman with no eyes offered me a vial of *second chances*—labeled in blood, sealed with a heartbeat.

I passed.

A child with crow wings tried to sell me a map made of stitched memories.

I passed again.

But then—

A stall tucked in the farthest corner. Quiet. Almost unnoticed.

It wasn’t what was *there* that pulled me in.

It was what was missing.

No sounds. No light. Just a table covered in black velvet, and a man hunched behind it, wearing gloves that didn’t match.

I stepped closer. Cain stayed back.

“Looking for something lost?” the man asked, his voice wrapped in smoke.

“I don’t know what I’ve lost,” I said.

He nodded like that was the right answer.

“Then maybe this will find you instead.”

He slid a ring across the velvet.

It was simple. Bronze. Cracked down the center—but pulsing faintly with a dull, amber glow.

The moment I touched it—

Pain.

Memory.

**Fire.**

⸻

I staggered back. Cain caught me.

“What the hell was that?” he snapped at the vendor.

But the stall was empty.

Just the ring on the velvet, still pulsing like a heartbeat.

Cain grabbed my wrist. “We’re leaving.”

“No,” I whispered, staring at the ring. “That was a piece of me.”

He didn’t let go.

But he didn’t pull me away either.

I reached out.

Took the ring.

It didn’t burn the second time.

It felt like it *fit.*

I should’ve dragged her out.

But when she touched that ring, something *shifted.*

Not just in her.

In me.

Like a door unlocking—far away, but tethered to my chest.

She looked up at me with eyes too ancient for a girl who barely remembered her name.

“I think I was someone else,” she said.

“You still are,” I said. “You’re not done becoming her yet.”

And gods help me… I wanted to see who she turned into.
