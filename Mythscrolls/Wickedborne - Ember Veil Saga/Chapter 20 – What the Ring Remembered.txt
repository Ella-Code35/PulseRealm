Chapter 20 – What the Ring Remembered  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The ring felt heavier now that it was mine.

It pulsed faintly against my skin, like a heartbeat that didn’t belong to this century. Or maybe even this world.

I kept turning it between my fingers as we walked, but I hadn’t put it on.

Not yet.

Cain hadn’t said a word since we left the market.  
Neither had I.

The silence between us wasn’t awkward.

It was heavy. Fragile. Sacred in a way I didn’t have language for.

⸻

We found a rooftop that smelled like rain and old magic—quiet, broken, and private.  

I sat on the ledge. He stood behind me, arms crossed, eyes scanning the dark like it might offer answers if he stared hard enough.

I spoke first.

“It knew me.”

Cain didn’t answer right away.

Then: “Yeah. I saw.”

“It *hurt.* Just touching it—like a fire under my skin. But it didn’t leave a mark.”

“Maybe it left something deeper,” he said. “Something it meant to wake.”

⸻

I stared down at the skyline—twisted glass towers and flickering glyph lights blinking like stars that forgot they were born underground.

“I’m scared,” I said softly.

Cain moved closer. “Of what?”

“Of remembering. Of *not* remembering. Of what it means if I’m not just a girl with no past. If I’m someone dangerous. Cursed. Or worse—someone who was already broken long before she woke up.”

“You’re not broken,” he said.

I looked at him.

And Cain Drossel—tattooed fighter, walking furnace of rage and control—looked straight back at me and said,

“You’re *becoming.*”

⸻

I turned the ring over once more.

It didn’t burn now. It didn’t even hum.

It just felt… familiar.

Like a name I used to whisper in sleep.

I slipped it onto my finger.

A jolt. Not pain.

More like pressure.

And then—

A flicker.

⸻

A vision.

**Not mine. Not fully.**

Just a flash:

- A girl with fire in her eyes and blood on her hands.
- Standing in a circle of glowing runes.
- Reaching for something—*someone*—before the world cracked open.

Then darkness.

Then Cain’s voice.

“Seraphina?”

I gasped.

My eyes focused again.

He was right there. One hand hovering near my shoulder, not touching.

I nodded. “I’m okay. Just… a memory.”

He sat beside me this time. Closer.

“Yours?”

“Maybe. Or someone I used to be.”

Silence again.

This time, it felt like safety.

⸻

I didn’t tell him that in the vision… the runes looked like the ones on his skin.

Or that the person she reached for wore a face that looked an awful lot like his.

Because I didn’t know what it meant.

And I wasn’t ready to break him with it yet.

POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

She was different now.

Not louder. Not sharper.

Just… *more.*

Like the memory had layered over her like smoke, and the edges of who she was before had started bleeding into the now.

But she still looked at me like I was real.

Like I was the only thing in this world that didn’t blur.

And for the first time in years—

That made me afraid.

Not of her.

Of *what I’d do to protect her.*

Even if she turned out to be the very thing I was born to destroy.
