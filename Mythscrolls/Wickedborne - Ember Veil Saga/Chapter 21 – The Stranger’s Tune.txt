Chapter 21 – The Stranger’s Tune  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The ring hadn’t pulsed since I put it on.

No more visions. No flashes. Just weight.

But it felt like it was listening.

I didn’t tell Cain that part.

He’d already looked at me like I might crack. I didn’t need him wondering if I’d shatter.

So I distracted myself with coffee and a walk through the haze-thick morning streets.

Cain walked beside me. Quiet, as always. But this time… less tense. Like he didn’t know how to ask the questions filling his lungs.

I didn’t offer answers either.

The city didn’t care about our silence. It was *alive* with motion. A beggar’s cup chimed behind us. Someone shouted at a spirit vendor across the street. Two kids floated above a market stall, fighting over a levitating peach.

And the street musician?

He played a melody that made the sigils on my skin itch.

⸻

We paused when we heard it. The notes were wrong in the right way—twisting through air like memory set to rhythm.

An old man sat on an overturned crate, fingers dancing across a stringed instrument I didn’t recognize.

His eyes were glazed. Not blind. Not quite awake either.

But the melody—

It wasn’t just haunting.

It was *familiar.*

“Do you hear that?” I asked Cain.

He didn’t answer right away.

Then: “It’s the song from your vision.”

I turned to him, startled.

He nodded. “Same cadence. Same pull.”

The old man looked up.

Right at me.

“Ah,” he rasped. “The flame has found its vessel again.”

My blood turned to ice.

Cain stepped forward. “Who are you?”

The old man laughed—raspy and soft.

“Just a musician, boy. Strings and dust. I play what the world forgets.”

He strummed again. And the ring on my hand *warmed.*

“You’ve walked this path before,” he said, voice like dried leaves. “Same shoes. Same stars. Different mistakes.”

“I don’t remember any of it,” I whispered.

“You will.”

His eyes flicked to Cain.

“And when you do… you’ll have to choose if you want it back.”

Then he smiled like he’d said something funny, and went back to playing.

Just a melody.

Just a stranger.

But I walked away shaking.

“I don’t trust him,” I said once we were out of earshot.

“Obviously,” Seraphina muttered. “He plays psychic riddles on a street corner.”

“That’s not what I mean.”

She looked up at me.

“He saw you,” I said. “*Really* saw you. And didn’t flinch. Didn’t bow. Didn’t run. That’s rare.”

“So what? You want me to panic because an old man with ghost fingers played my theme song?”

I snorted. Couldn’t help it.

She grinned. “That was almost a smile.”

“Shut up.”

⸻

We reached the Charm Yard just as Nia was opening the front gate.

She looked up. Blinked.

Then: “You brought the brooding slab of muscle to my happy place?”

“You’re welcome,” I muttered.

Nia ignored me and tugged Seraphina inside by the wrist.  
“You smell like haunted questions. Come in. I made tea that might make you forget your name, and cookies that taste like lying to your therapist.”

Seraphina let out an unexpected laugh—light, startled, real.

I looked at her. That sound hit harder than I was ready for. Like it cracked something open under my ribs.

And yeah, I smirked.

Couldn’t help it.

She glanced at me, and for a heartbeat, there was something unspoken between us—like we both knew the moment had weight, but neither of us would name it out loud.

I followed them inside.

Still smirking.

And gods help me, I didn’t even fight it.
