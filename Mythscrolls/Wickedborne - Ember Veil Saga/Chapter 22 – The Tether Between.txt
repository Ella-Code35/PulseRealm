Chapter 22 – The Tether Between  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

Nia had a tea for everything.

Tension? Chamomile with venomroot.  
Heartbreak? Rosebud with black salt.  
Existential crisis from a cursed ring unlocking past lives and mysterious strangers who know your name?

Apparently, the answer was raspberry mint with a dash of whatever-the-hell made my lips tingle.

I took another cautious sip.

Nia watched me like a hawk watches a squirrel trying to flirt with traffic.

“You’re twitchy.”

“I’m fine.”

“You’re vibrating.”

“I’m *fine.*”

She leaned back, hands behind her head. “If you implode in my shop, you better do it over the discount bin. I’m not scraping your trauma out of my incense drawer.”

Cain, who had claimed a corner near the wall, *actually chuckled* under his breath.

I didn’t even bother glaring. He just raised one brow like he’d been waiting for that reaction.

⸻

The ring on my finger hadn’t pulsed again.

But I could feel its weight. Like it was sitting inside my spine.  
Not dangerous. Not violent.

Just *awake.*

Like it was waiting for me to be ready.

I stared at it.

“Okay, listen,” I muttered under my breath. “If you’re sentient and planning to whisper cryptic stuff into my dreams, can we at least agree on one thing?”

Cain looked over from where he leaned against the wall, brow raised.

“No murder prophecies before coffee,” I finished, wagging a finger at the ring like it owed me rent.

There was a beat of silence.

Then Cain… *smiled*.

A real one.

Not a smirk. Not a ghost of one. But an actual, startled grin like I’d caught him off guard and he didn’t hate it.

“What?” I said.

“You talk to jewelry,” he said.

“You sulk at drywall.”

His smile deepened.

“I wasn’t sulking.”

I gave him a look.

“Fine,” he said. “Maybe a little.”

Nia made a choking sound behind us and held up her tea like she was toasting the entire scene. “Congratulations, you’ve achieved *banter.* Next step: emotional vulnerability and probably cuddling. You’re welcome.”

Cain’s grin vanished.

Mine didn’t.

⸻

“You think it’s from your past life?” Nia asked. Her tone was casual. The sharpness in her eyes was not.

“I don’t know.”

“Could be a soul relic,” she mused. “Echoes of old magic sometimes bind themselves to an object when the person dies. Especially if they died messy.”

“…Thanks.”

Cain spoke, low. “It responded to her. That means it was made *for* her. Or *by* her.”

That made me pause.

*By* me?

The idea twisted something inside my ribs. A strange ache. Not fear. Not pride.

*Longing.*

⸻

The bell above the shop door jingled.

We all turned.

The guy who walked in looked like he belonged on a noir detective cover—trench coat, shadows stitched into his sleeves, eyes like cracked coal.

“Valentine,” Nia said, sighing. “If you’re here for the soul jars, they’re still cursed.”

“Weren’t last time,” he said, voice as dry as Cain’s left hook.

“Yeah, well. One tried to bite me.”

He glanced around. His gaze snagged on me for a second. Paused.

Something *flickered*.

Recognition? Confusion?

Then it passed.

“Didn’t know you had new clients,” he muttered to Nia.

“She’s not a client. She’s a walking fire hazard with a destiny complex.”

“Ah,” he said. “One of *those.*”

He moved toward the back of the shop, disappeared behind the beaded curtain like a memory that refused to stay still.

“…Friend of yours?” I asked.

Nia shrugged. “Val? He’s an information broker. Sometimes sells false memories. Sometimes buys real ones. Don’t trust him. Don’t try to flirt with him. Don’t give him your name.”

Cain was still watching the curtain.

I was still trying to figure out why my stomach turned when Valentine looked at me like that.

⸻

Later, after Cain walked me home, I stood at my window and stared at the ring again.

I didn’t put it back in the drawer.

I wore it.

Because part of me *needed* to feel it.

Needed the weight.

Needed to know it hadn’t been a dream. That I wasn’t crazy.

And when I fell asleep that night, curled under my blanket, I dreamed of runes that bled light and a voice I couldn’t place whispering,

> “Don’t let go again.”

POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

Something was changing.

Not with her. Not just.

With *me.*

The tether didn’t stop humming after we parted. It stayed *alive*—a quiet pressure beneath my skin, coiled and warm.

I didn’t like that I missed her voice.

Didn’t like that I caught myself remembering the way she laughed when Nia insulted her.

Didn’t like that Valentine looked at her too long.

I wasn’t supposed to *care.*

I’d spent years training myself to stop feeling shit that wasn’t useful. But she was useful. Dangerous. Curious.

*Mine.*

Not in the possessive way.

In the *cosmic collision* kind of way. The kind where the universe doesn’t give you a choice—it just draws a line, hands you a name, and waits to see what you’ll burn to keep it.

I closed my eyes.

And the last thing I saw was her smile—

and the ring that wouldn’t stop glowing.
