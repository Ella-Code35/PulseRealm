Chapter 23 – The Watching Flame  
POV: Unknown

⸻

She wore the ring.

The echo quivered through the sigil-veins etched beneath the city.  
Lanterns dimmed. Dust danced in slow spirals. And deep, deep below the ground—something old stirred.

Not awakened.

Not yet.

But *aware.*

Eyes blinked open in the dark.  
Five of them.

Not human. Not monstrous.

Something in-between. Something… lost.

They tasted her magic on the wind.  
They felt the ripple in the leyline.

And they whispered her name like it was both prayer and warning.

“Seraphina…”

POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I woke with a start. Not from a dream. From something *else.*

A feeling. A pressure. A sensation crawling down my back like invisible hands threading through my spine.

The ring was glowing faintly.

So was the burn mark.

I sat up, heartbeat slow but *loud.*  
Too loud.

The apartment was silent. Moonlight filtered through the half-drawn curtains. Everything *looked* normal.

It didn’t *feel* normal.

I padded barefoot into the hallway. Nia’s door was closed. Her soft snores echoed beyond it—unbothered. Blissfully unaware.

Just me, then.

Of course it was.

I turned the ring on my finger slowly. It felt heavier than before. Like something had latched onto it. Like I was suddenly *on someone’s map.*

A quiet voice in my head whispered:  
**Run.**

Another one—lower, older, *mine*—said:  
**Burn them first.**

I wasn’t sure which was smarter. Or more dangerous.

I met Nia at the kitchen counter in the morning. She was already awake, stirring something that hissed purple steam.

She blinked at me. “You look like you woke up from a funeral.”

“Thanks.”

“Was it yours?”

“…Not sure.”

She sipped her concoction. “If you die, can I have the ring?”

“Nia.”

“Fine. I’ll bury it with you. Like a good friend. But I’m not promising I won’t *dig it back up later.*”

I grinned despite myself.  
**Cain appeared a few minutes later, dressed like he hadn’t slept either. Apparently, he’d crashed on Nia’s couch and made friends with her cursed cat.**

He leaned against the kitchen doorway—  
And he was watching me like I’d just come back from somewhere *he couldn’t follow.*

There was no teasing. No jewelry sass.  
Just the quiet weight of three souls in a kitchen built from clutter and bad ideas.  

**Until Nia’s cat—Grimalkin the Problem—leapt from the top of the fridge, landed on the counter, and *slapped my toast off the plate.***

I blinked.

“Really?” I asked.

He stared at me with ancient contempt, like I’d wronged his ancestors.

Cain raised an eyebrow. “Is it cursed?”

“He’s not cursed,” Nia said, sipping her tea. “He *casts* curses. There’s a difference.”

The cat yawned, showed too many teeth, and settled on my warm spot like it belonged to him now.

Cain kept watching me.

And despite the clawed toast sacrifice…  
I didn’t look away.
