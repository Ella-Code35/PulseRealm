Chapter 24 – Something in the Air  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The city smelled different that morning.

Not the way it always does—metal, smoke, fried sugar, and the occasional whiff of something *dying* in the sewers.  
This was subtler.

Something electric.  
Something ancient.

Like the air remembered magic.

⸻

I walked beside Cain without really meaning to.

We weren’t going anywhere specific. Not at first. But when I said I needed fresh air, he offered to come. And I didn’t say no.

Now we moved through the morning market like two magnets—drawn close, but never quite touching.

The crowd buzzed around us.  
Vendors shouting. Coins clinking. Spells whispered in narrow alleys.  
It should’ve felt normal.

It didn’t.

People looked at me a second too long.  
A kid dropped her balloon when I passed. A dog refused to walk by me, tail tucked, eyes wide.

Cain noticed.

“You’re drawing attention,” he said quietly.

“I’m not doing anything.”

“Exactly,” he muttered. “That’s the problem.”

We stopped at a vendor with glowing fruit and charms shaped like teeth. The stall keeper smiled wide—too wide—and didn’t blink once.

I didn’t buy anything.

⸻

“Did you sleep?” I asked Cain as we moved on.

“Not really.”

“You looked comfortable on the couch.”

“Your friend’s cat tried to hex me.”

“You probably deserved it.”

He almost smiled.

“Do you always talk to jewelry?” he asked after a beat.

I shot him a side glance. “Do you always scowl at strangers like they insulted your bloodline?”

“I *have* no bloodline.”

“That explains the scowling.”

That earned me the corner of a grin. Not the full thing. But *more* than usual.

Progress.

⸻

We paused at a coffee cart. Cain paid before I could argue. The barista handed me something foamy and suspiciously glowing. I drank it anyway.

It tasted like lightning and hope.

Cain sipped his own, then nodded toward the street.

“You don’t feel it?”

“The stares?”

“No. The air.”

I closed my eyes.

And yeah.

There it was.

Not wind. Not magic.

Something else.

A hum beneath the city.  
Like the leyline was singing in its sleep.  
And every step we took brought us closer to wherever it was dreaming.

“What do you think it means?” I asked.

Cain’s jaw clenched.

“That something’s coming,” he said. “And you’re the reason.”

He didn’t say it like an accusation.

More like a fact.

And somehow… that was worse.

⸻

We sat on a cracked bench beneath a dead tree that someone had painted purple stars all over. It shouldn’t have been peaceful. But it was.

Cain pulled out a small pocket knife and began carving something into the bench’s edge. I didn’t ask what.

The sky above us flickered. Just once.

I looked up.  
Saw nothing.

But I felt it again.

That hum.

That pull.

Like the world was *tuning itself around me.*

Cain hadn’t moved.

He just kept carving.  
And his voice, when it came, was almost too soft to hear.

“I don’t know who you are,” he said.  
“But something in me… thinks I did. Once.”

I didn’t answer.

Didn’t breathe.

Just watched him.

And for the first time, I wondered…

What if he was right?

What if the person I used to be *had known him?*

What if that was why he scared me?  
Not because he was dangerous…

But because he was *familiar.*
