Chapter 25 – Foxes and Fault Lines  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I found Nia surrounded by chaos.

Which, for her, meant everything was *completely normal.*

She sat cross-legged on the living room floor, tinkering with a music box that played different melodies depending on what emotion you were suppressing.  
It was currently stuck on *grief*, and crooning a lullaby that made my spine itch.

“Still broken?” I asked.

“Still lying to itself,” she muttered, flicking the box’s gears. “Just like you.”

I dropped a bag of snacks beside her.

Her eyes lit up. “My love language.”

⸻

We sat in silence for a while.

Nia hummed tunelessly, occasionally testing the music box.  
I stared at the ceiling, wondering how much longer it would take before the sky cracked open again.

Eventually she spoke.

“Cain still brooding?”

“He broods with style.”

“Of course he does,” she said, mock-sighing. “All that smolder and jawline? Has to come with *something* dramatic. Does he write poetry in blood yet?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “But he looks at me like he *wants* to.”

Nia raised a brow. “Is that good or terrifying?”

“…Yes.”

She grinned. “Feen, you’ve got it *bad.*”

I tried not to smile.

⸻

“I feel like I’m being followed,” I said after a pause.

Nia didn’t laugh.

Instead, she reached into her coat and pulled out a charm—a small fox carved from bone, inked with faint red runes.

“Wear this.”

“What does it do?”

“Wards off surveillance enchantments. Or summons a ghost with really bad advice. Fifty-fifty.”

I took it anyway.

She threaded the charm onto a cord and tied it around my wrist. Her fingers brushed the inside of my arm, where the sigil still pulsed under my skin.

Her smile faltered. Just for a second.

“You’re changing,” she said softly.

“I know.”

“Does it scare you?”

“…It should.”

I glanced at the tea she’d handed me.  
It tasted like safety.

Which was weird.  
Because nothing in my life was safe.  
Not even the way the fox charm pulsed once against my wrist—like it disagreed.

⸻

The door creaked open without a knock.

“*Ladies!*”

Rabbit stood in the doorway, holding a lopsided container of suspicious-looking dumplings and wearing the proud smile of someone who had definitely not been invited.

Nia narrowed her eyes. “Did you just *pick* my lock?”

“Cain said you make dumplings that taste like spiritual therapy. I had to know if it was true.”

“You broke in for dumplings?”

“And your radiant company.”

She stared at him.

He held up the container like a peace offering.

“…They might still be warm?”

She snatched one and bit into it with surgical precision.

Rabbit watched her like she’d just pulled Excalibur from a trash bin.

“Okay, you just—*no hesitation*—bit that thing like you knew it wouldn’t kill you. That’s hot.”

Nia chewed slowly. “You’re weirder than Cain.”

Rabbit looked scandalized. “How *dare.*”

“Did you want something?” I asked, fighting a laugh.

“I was in the neighborhood,” Rabbit said innocently. “Following a rumor about illegal potion poker, but that fell through. So I thought: ‘Hey, I know someone who makes snacks that taste like *emotional closure wrapped in dough.’’”

Nia snorted. “Still a stretch.”

“No, *this* is a stretch,” he said, doing a ridiculous lunge. “Anyway.”

He straightened, then shifted awkwardly. For once, Rabbit looked less like a chaos gremlin and more like a guy unsure if he’d just stepped on a landmine.

“So,” he said, clearing his throat. “I was wondering if you’d want to maybe… go out sometime.”

Nia blinked. “Out where?”

“Like… out *out.* You. Me. Food. Probably not dumplings. Unless you’re into danger.”

She squinted at him.

“Is this because I didn’t hex you last time?”

“No,” Rabbit said quickly. “Yes. A little. Mostly because I think you’re smart, mildly terrifying, and you have excellent taste in tea and verbal takedowns.”

Nia stared.

Then tossed him another dumpling.

“…Pick me up at seven. Don’t be weird.”

Rabbit caught it mid-air, absolutely beaming.

“No promises.”

⸻

Later that night, Nia threw a blanket over my head and shoved a mug into my hands like it was first aid.

“You’re spiraling,” she said. “You need tea. And trash television. Or a dramatic reading of hexed romance novels.”

“Is that the one where the witch dates a cursed spreadsheet?”

“Don’t mock my literature.”

I laughed. For real.

And for a moment… everything felt still.

I still hadn’t figured out what Ezra’s deal was.  
He showed up like a glitch in the matrix—gone before you could catch the shape of him, but loud in your head afterward.

And Cain… Cain felt too present. Like gravity.

⸻

But outside the window, across the street—

A shadow stood beneath the flickering lamp.

Not moving. Not watching.

*Waiting.*

By the time I blinked, it was gone.

But I felt it in my blood.

Something was shifting again.

And this time… I wouldn’t be the only one changing.
