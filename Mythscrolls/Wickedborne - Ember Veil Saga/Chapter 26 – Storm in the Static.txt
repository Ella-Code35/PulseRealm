Chapter 26 – Storm in the Static  
POV: Cain Drossel

⸻

The city buzzed different tonight.

Not the kind of hum you ignore, not traffic or neon signs whining through the fog. This was a *beneath the skin* buzz. The kind of static you get before lightning strikes. The kind that warned *something* was about to uncoil.

I stood on the balcony of the gym’s second floor, eyes fixed on nothing, cigarette burning slow between my fingers.

Below, Rabbit was attempting to reorganize the gym’s cursed equipment with a system only he understood. Every time a dumbbell rolled off on its own or a punching bag whispered insults, he’d shout “IT’S EXPRESSING ITSELF!” like that explained anything.

The truth? It *did.*

Some of the gear in this place had been touched by magic. A few pieces were outright cursed, but I’d kept them. You learn more about a fighter by the way they react to a barbell that *bites back*.

And Rabbit? He was their favorite chew toy.

I didn’t stop him. Chaos calmed him.

And I needed him calm.

Because something was *off*.

The sigils under my skin itched like they were trying to crawl out. The one over my heart hadn't stopped humming since the last time I saw her.

Seraphina Vale.

She’d stepped into my world like a glitch in fate’s programming—and now the whole system was spitting sparks.

⸻

I still hadn’t told Rabbit everything.

Didn’t tell him the mark on my chest had pulsed when she laughed.

Didn’t tell him how I’d tried every scent trail, energy flare scan, and warded location spell I had—and came up dry every damn time.

She didn’t exist in the ways I knew how to search.

Except in the one that mattered most—she existed *to me.*

⸻

“Cain!”

I blinked down. Rabbit was squinting at a set of barbell racks that had started vibrating like angry tuning forks.

“You think this is a possession or just bad energy?”

“Depends. Did you insult them again?”

He held up his hands innocently. “I only said they lacked aesthetic integrity.”

The weight racks slammed themselves to the ground with enough force to make the walls shudder.

Rabbit dove behind a bench, grinning like a lunatic. “You *cannot* tell me they’re not dramatic.”

I didn’t smile. But I didn’t stop him, either.

⸻

Later, when the gym had quieted and the wards were back to a soft purr, I found Rabbit sitting cross-legged on the roof with a bowl of spicy noodles and a bottle of moon cider.

He noticed me eyeing the bowl.

Immediately, he hunched over it like a raccoon guarding a stolen gem.

“Don’t even think about it,” he warned, clutching the bowl tighter. “This was a *battle.*”

I raised an eyebrow.

“**Nia** booby-trapped the pantry with a snare charm. I *dangled*, Cain. Upside down. For like three minutes. It was humiliating.”

“You broke into her kitchen?”

“It was barely locked! And technically, I jimmied it, which is very different.”

I gave him a look.

Rabbit jabbed a chopstick toward me like a wand. “These noodles are the divine reward for my trials. I suffered. I earned this. And it’s Nia’s cooking—we don’t share Nia’s cooking, Cain. *Not even with the gods.*”

He went back to eating, muttering something reverent between slurps. I was ninety percent sure I saw a tear in his eye.

“You’re unbelievable,” I said.

He didn’t even pause. “Unbelievably fed. And spiritually fulfilled.”

⸻

He patted the rooftop beside him, and I sat down, the city yawning dark and endless before us.

“What’s on your mind, oh broody overlord?”

“Her.”

Rabbit didn’t ask who.

“Still can’t track her?”

I shook my head. “It’s like something’s jamming the threads. Even the best bloodmarks won’t hold her trail longer than a few seconds.”

Rabbit whistled low. “Damn. She’s got *built-in vanish mode.* I like her more already.”

“She doesn’t anchor right,” I muttered. “Like she’s not all… here.”

Rabbit tilted his head. “You mean like metaphysically? Or, like, spooky girl from a tragic indie film who keeps turning into crows?”

I didn’t smile.

“It’s not about tracking her,” I said finally. “It’s about *what happens when she’s gone.* The quiet gets too loud. The world tilts wrong. Like something’s missing, and the mark won’t let me forget it.”

Rabbit watched me for a beat. “You’re not being warned, Cain. You’re being *called.* Back to something you forgot.”

That hit harder than I wanted it to.

⸻

Before I could respond, Rabbit’s head tilted.

“What?”

“Someone’s coming,” he said.

I stood before the door even opened.

Footsteps on the stairs. Light. Quick. Familiar.

Seraphina stepped into view.

And even before she spoke, the mark on my chest flared once—hot and certain.

“Sorry to crash your roof party,” she said, eyes darting between us.

Rabbit beamed. “You brought snacks?”

“I brought a question.”

Her eyes locked on mine.

And for once, the static in my veins quieted.

Only long enough to listen.
