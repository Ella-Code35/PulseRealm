Chapter 27 – The Question That Wasn't a Question  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I didn’t mean to go looking for him.

I’d told myself I was just taking a walk. Letting the city breathe around me like it had something to say. But somehow, my feet ended up at the gym—*his* gym—and now I was standing on a rooftop under a sky that didn’t know how to be quiet.

Cain was already watching me when I stepped into the open.

His expression unreadable. But his body had stilled in a way that told me everything. He hadn’t expected me—but he’d *wanted* me to come.

Next to him, Rabbit beamed like this was all part of his prophecy.

“You brought snacks?” he asked.

“I brought a question,” I said.

I looked at Cain.

And something in him tilted toward me, like a tree leaning into a storm it had no intention of surviving.

⸻

We didn’t speak right away.

Instead, Cain gestured toward the rooftop edge and I followed, the wind tugging at my coat. The city stretched beneath us like a restless beast, all flickering windows and hungry streets.

I finally asked it: “What are we?”

He didn’t flinch.

“What do you want us to be?” he asked.

His voice was low. Steady. But I heard the crack underneath.

“I don’t know,” I admitted.

“I don’t either,” he said.

But he *did*. I could feel it. The same pull that hadn’t left me since the first time we touched.

⸻

Behind us, Rabbit cleared his throat loudly.

“Sorry to interrupt the brooding-and-simmering hour,” he said, standing up and brushing off his jeans, “but I have a date.”

I blinked. “You do?”

“With *dumplings.* And possibly the person who made them. But mostly the dumplings.”

Cain arched a brow. “You mean Nia?”

Rabbit shrugged, grin unrepentant. “She said *‘Don’t be weird.’* Which, let’s be honest, is a yes with conditions.”

I snorted. “You’re incapable of meeting those conditions.”

“Exactly,” he said. “It’s going to be *incredible.*”

Then he was gone—hopping down the rooftop exit like it was his personal stage and he’d just dropped the mic.

⸻

I didn’t know what to do with the silence he left behind.

Cain shifted beside me. Not closer. Just… deeper.

His presence felt like a storm right before it broke open.

“When I saw you,” he said quietly, “something woke up.”

My breath caught.

He wasn’t looking at me, not directly. But I could feel him seeing me all the same.

“Like I’d been asleep for years and didn’t even know it. And then… there you were. Breathing like you belonged in every room I forgot how to live in.”

I stared out at the city. My fingers tightened around the edge of my coat.

“I don’t know what I am yet,” I whispered. “Or what this thing inside me is. But it’s loud when you’re near. Like it remembers something I don’t.”

Cain was silent for a long beat.  
Then, without a word, he stepped closer. Not all the way—just enough for the wind to catch his warmth. His hand found the edge of my coat and pulled it tighter around my shoulders.

Not claiming. Not caging. Just *there.*

“Whatever it is, Seraphina…” he said, voice low, “it’s not just you.”

I turned to look at him.

“I feel it too.”

⸻

We stood there as the city pulsed below.

Not touching. Not running.

Just two broken things that recognized the shape of each other’s scars.

And in that fragile moment, something between us *settled.*

Not as a promise. Not yet.

But as a truth we’d both stopped trying to ignore.
