Chapter 28 – Ghosts in the Wake  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I couldn’t sleep.

Not because something was wrong—but because something felt… too *right*.

Cain’s touch still lingered on my coat like a promise that hadn’t been spoken out loud. And Rabbit’s grin echoed louder than it should, the memory of it trailing behind him like confetti.

The rooftop had shifted something. Tilted the floor beneath my thoughts.

I wandered into the kitchen at dawn, barefoot and hollow-eyed, only to find Nia already there, trying to pour milk into a bowl of cereal while her cat sat *inside* the bowl.

“Dumpling,” she said flatly, “we’ve talked about this.”

The cat blinked one amber eye. Tail twitching. Utterly unapologetic.

Nia sighed and poured the milk into a coffee mug instead.

“Morning, sugarplague.”

“You’re calling *me* that?”

“You looked like you died in your sleep and just forgot to lay down.”

I slumped onto a stool. “Can you be nice before caffeine?”

“No.”

She handed me a mug anyway.

⸻

We sat in the quiet, the kind of silence that only existed between friends who didn’t need to fill it.

Eventually, I said, “I talked to Cain again.”

Nia raised one brow, but said nothing.

“I don’t know what this is.”

“Good,” she said. “You’re not supposed to. Not yet.”

“But I feel like I’m already halfway down the cliff.”

Nia snorted. “Then you better hope he’s not made of rocks at the bottom.”

There was a pause.

Then she added, “You *do* like him, though.”

I hesitated. “I like… the version of myself that exists when he looks at me.”

Nia leaned back in her chair, mug between both hands. “Well, damn. That’s a line I’d steal for my vows.”

⸻

Dumpling leapt from the counter and disappeared into the shadows like a spectral judge of poor life decisions.

And I… got dressed.

I didn’t know why, exactly. But the burn mark under my skin was restless again. And when I looked out the window, the city felt like it was *waiting.*

I tugged on a coat and grabbed the charm Nia gave me last week—the one that only worked when you weren’t looking for anything in particular.

It pulsed once in my palm.

Then dimmed.

—

I took that as a yes.

⸻

The underground market wasn’t the same during the day.

It breathed different. Quieter. Hungrier.

Some of the stalls were shuttered. Others were manned by people who looked like they’d eaten sunlight for breakfast and regretted every bite.

I wandered with no destination. Let my feet carry me between alleys laced with broken time, ghost-glass windows, and paper lanterns that blinked when I passed.

Something was pulling me again.

And I didn’t fight it.

I saw her from across the courtyard.

Not the woman the world would’ve seen. Not the black coat. Not the curious eyes.

But *her.*

The shape beneath the magic.

The tether.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

She was trailing her fingers over a display of soulthread rings like they weren’t screaming in her presence.

And the moment one brushed her skin—every mirror in the stall *shattered.*

She blinked.

The vendor screamed.

And I stepped forward without thinking.

“Leave it,” I said.

The vendor froze. So did she.

Her eyes met mine.

They were wide. Bright. Feral and unfamiliar.

But something behind them saw me.

I felt it.

A ghost pressed against glass.

She opened her mouth to speak.

Then flinched—because her mark had just burned through her coat.

We both felt it.

And in that heartbeat, the world narrowed to two people and a hundred thousand unsaid things.

But I didn’t let her speak.

I turned. Fast. Gone before I could finish the sentence I never started.

Because if I stayed, I’d do something stupid.

Like reach for her.

Like remember.

⸻

He was gone.

One blink, and the man who’d stared at me like a prophecy had vanished like fog in heat.

But the mirrors…

I looked down.

The shattered pieces still trembled with the echo of something *old.*

And the ring? The one that had sparked it all?

It was on my finger.

Even though I hadn’t put it there.

⸻

POV: Ezra Thorne

⸻

She didn’t recognize me.

That should’ve made it easier.

It didn’t.

I stood three rooftops away now—watching the shattered reflection of a moment I should’ve never stepped into.

The ring had chosen her. Not just touched. *Claimed.*

And she didn’t even know what it meant.

I clenched my jaw, fists buried in coat pockets lined with dust and sigils.

This wasn’t supposed to happen yet.

She wasn’t supposed to be *awake.*

And gods help me… I wasn’t supposed to care.

But I did.

Because even with the soul fractures and fogged memory—

She still looked at me like she remembered the sound of my silence.

Like she once trusted me with something holy.

And I couldn’t decide if I wanted to earn that again… or run before it destroyed us both.

So I did what I always did.

I vanished.
