Chapter 29 – The Ring That Shouldn’t Be  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The ring hadn’t left my finger since the night it appeared—silent, still, like it was waiting. But here, in the market’s hum of magic and shadows, it pulsed again—sharper. Stronger. Like something inside it had finally *woken up.*

Slick silver, warm to the touch, carved with ancient runes I didn’t recognize but still *understood*. Like a lullaby hummed in a forgotten language.

I stared at it, flexing my hand. The weight wasn’t physical.

It was *presence.*

Not threatening. Not urgent.

Just… watchful.

Like it was waiting to see what kind of girl I really was.

⸻

“You buy that?”

The voice jolted me.

The vendor had returned—carefully stepping around the broken glass, his aura bristling with annoyance and fear.

I blinked.

“I—no. It was—”

He studied the ring for half a second longer than he should have.

“It was already yours, wasn’t it? That ring. It just didn’t know how to *speak* until now.”

Then he waved a hand. “If it stuck to you, it’s yours.”

“That’s not how—”

“It *is* here,” he cut in. “Next time, don’t touch the old threads unless you’re ready to wear them.”

Then he went back to rearranging what was left of his stall, grumbling under his breath in a language that burned a little in my ears.

I didn’t argue.

Because he was right.

The ring had *chosen* me.

And that meant something. Something I hadn’t earned yet.

⸻

I left the market with too many eyes at my back and one more secret wrapped around my bones.

The streets above were waking up now—city noises blooming like weeds. Horns. Music. Coffee carts. Stray spells that hadn’t been tied down properly whispering through alleyways.

But my thoughts were stuck on *him.*

That man.

The one with shadows in his eyes and memory in his silence.

The one who vanished before I could ask who the hell he thought I was.

And why he looked at me like I *used to be someone*.

⸻

When I got back to Nia’s apartment, she was attempting to enchant a coffeemaker.

It was not going well.

“Why is it humming?” I asked.

“It’s *vibrating with caffeinated purpose.* Don’t judge.”

I raised a brow as the machine spat out a puff of steam and moaned ominously.

“Pretty sure it’s dying.”

“Pretty sure you don’t know art when you see it.”

I smiled despite myself—and for once, the ache in my chest dulled.

Then Nia glanced at my hand.

And froze.

“…Where’d you get that?”

I looked down.

The ring pulsed once.

“I’ve had it for a while,” I said. “But it’s… different now. It reacted at the market.”

Nia’s face stayed unreadable for a beat too long. Then she handed me a spoon.

“Stir this while I pretend not to be concerned.”

“Does it hurt?” she asked finally, her voice quieter now.

I shook my head. “Not yet.”

“Do you feel different?”

I hesitated.

“I don’t know.”

Neither of us said what we were really thinking.

Was I scared?  
I didn’t want to be.  
But when someone you trust looks at you like you’ve started becoming something *other*, it scratches at the edges of your soul.  
I wasn’t just changing.  
I was being *claimed.*  
By something I didn’t understand.

But the silence between us had changed.

It wasn’t just concern.

It was *recognition.*

⸻

The ring on my finger gleamed.

And I realized—

Whatever I was waking up into…

It wasn’t *done* with me yet.

“She’s still breathing,” I said.

The voice on the other end of the line didn’t respond right away.

“…And?”

“And she has the ring.”

Another pause. This one colder.

“She *shouldn’t* have it.”

“I know.”

“She *shouldn’t* be *awake*.”

“I *know.*”

The line went dead.

I exhaled slowly and dropped the burner phone into a passing delivery truck’s open window.

Then kept walking.

The city didn’t blink.

Neither did I.

Because the moment I did—

I’d remember how she looked when the ring lit up.

And the way her magic recognized *mine* like a soul trying to come home.

The ring was never meant to survive this long. Not without me. Not without her.
