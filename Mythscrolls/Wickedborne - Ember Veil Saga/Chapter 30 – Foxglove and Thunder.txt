Chapter 30 – Foxglove and Thunder  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

Nia’s enchanted coffeemaker exploded at dawn.

To be fair, she *did* try to infuse it with a time-loop sigil and a blessed coffee bean from the monastery of Eternal Jitters.

Still.

It exploded.

The kitchen smelled like regret and cinnamon. I sat on the counter, legs swinging, a cup of tea steaming in my hands.

Not coffee.

Not after the coffeemaker screamed.

Nia poked her head around the corner, singed bangs stuck to her forehead.

“So…bad news: I may have banished caffeine from this kitchen indefinitely.”

“I think it just screamed in Latin,” I said.

“Correction: *angry* Latin.”

I sipped my tea. “Still better than my last night.”

She raised a brow at me, but before she could ask, I tilted my head and aimed the question back at her.

“So… how was *your* night?”

She paused. “What do you mean?”

I grinned over my cup. “You know what I mean. Rabbit. Dinner. Did he set anything on fire? Or try to summon something weird in a restaurant bathroom?”

Nia made a face. “Only his ego. And he *did* try to order ten appetizers because he couldn’t choose just one.”

“That sounds about right.”

“He also gave me a flower. From someone’s balcony. I *think* he stole it.”

I laughed. “That actually sounds kind of sweet.”

She groaned. “It was a plastic flower. Covered in glitter. I’ve still got sparkles in my hair.”

I blinked. “So… second date?”

She paused… and then shrugged. “Maybe.”

⸻

But the lightness didn’t last.

The silence between us wasn’t empty. It was humming.

Like the ring on my finger.  
Like the tension in my chest.  
Like the memory of *him.*

Ezra.

And the way his presence in that market had twisted something under my skin.

Like he *knew* me.

Like the ring had recognized something I hadn’t.

⸻

I set down the tea and touched the ring.

No pulse. No heat. Just that quiet weight again.

Like it was settling in.

“Still alive?” Nia asked, munching on her burnt pastry.

“Barely.”

“Cool. Wanna break into a garden?”

I blinked. “What?”

“There’s a warded herbalist’s maze that only blooms once every hundred days. Tonight’s the night. Thought it might be fun.”

“That’s your idea of fun?”

“Beats sitting around waiting for more weird shit to happen.”

She wasn’t wrong.

Nia grinned. “Besides, I might’ve already mentioned it to Rabbit.”

I blinked. “*You invited Rabbit* to a magically sealed garden?”

She shrugged. “He’s practically made of mischief. I figured if we hit a cursed vine or a sentient bush, he’d either charm it, insult it, or die trying.”

“...Probably all three,” I muttered.

As if summoned by sarcasm, the front door creaked open.

“Did someone say cursed vine?” Rabbit’s voice called out. “Because I brought hedge clippers. And snacks.”

He strolled in, sunglasses on at night, a duffel bag over one shoulder, and a grin like he’d been *waiting his whole life* for this chaos.

⸻

We went after sundown.

The maze was at the edge of the city—a private garden grown wild, surrounded by sigils and snarling ivy. Nia whispered the entry rune and the vines parted like curtain strings.

It was beautiful.

Moonflowers with teeth.  
Foxglove that purred.  
Vines that whispered lullabies from lost mothers.

We wandered in, shoulder to shoulder, past petals that shimmered in languages I couldn’t read.

It didn’t feel dangerous.

It felt like… wonder.

Like maybe, *some* magic wasn’t trying to kill me.

Yet.

⸻

Nia found a glowing root and tucked it behind my ear.

I found a pocketwatch growing from a mushroom.

We didn’t ask questions.

Rabbit poked at a plant that belched glitter and laughed like he’d won the lottery.

But the deeper we went, the more the air felt… *thick.*

Like something old was breathing beneath the roots.

We stopped in a clearing surrounded by nightbloom violets.

Nia crouched. “This one heals bruises *and* sarcasm.”

“Good. I’m running low on both.”

She smirked and tossed me a sprig.

That’s when the wind shifted.

And the back of my neck prickled.

Someone else was here.

Not in the maze.

*Watching.*

“Feen?” Nia’s voice softened. “You good?”

I opened my mouth—

And the ring pulsed once.

A low hum that vibrated through my teeth.

I turned—fast.

But there was only shadow.

Only silence.

Only the rustle of flowers that shouldn’t know how to listen.

I stayed hidden in the folds of the garden’s deeper edges.

Not because I was afraid.

But because she wasn’t ready.

The ring recognized her.  
The maze opened for her.  
The *old blood* called her name.

But she didn’t hear it yet.

Not clearly.

Not like I did.

So I watched.

Just a little longer.

Until she was ready to remember—

*me.*
