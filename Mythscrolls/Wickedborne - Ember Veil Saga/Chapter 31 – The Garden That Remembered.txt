Chapter 31 – The Garden That Remembered  
POV: Seraphina Vale  

⸻

The maze didn’t have a gate.  

It *bloomed* open.  

One second we were staring at a solid wall of ivy, and the next—  
A hush.  
A sigh.  
And a soft, green parting like the world itself held its breath.  

It wasn’t inviting. Not really.  
But it wasn’t *warning us off*, either.  

It was waiting.  

I felt it down in my bones.

Nia whistled low. “Creepy, ten out of ten.”  

Rabbit practically skipped past us with a bag of jerky. “Let’s not die.”  

⸻

The inside of the maze was warmer than it should’ve been. Damp. Lush. Alive.  

The paths twisted at impossible angles—some sharp as blades, others looping like a child’s scrawl. Vines slithered lazily across the ground, and flowers blinked in and out of visibility like they couldn’t decide which realm they belonged to.  

“This place is a crime against cartography,” Rabbit muttered, licking his fingers and tucking away a half-eaten dumpling like it was precious cargo.  

I paused at a fork in the path. Something tugged at me.  

Left.  

No sound. No vision. No divine whisper.  
Just… a pull.  

Like the garden remembered me.  

And wanted me to remember *it*.  

“Left,” I said.  

Rabbit squinted. “That’s oddly specific. Mystic gut vibes or are you just guessing with flair?”  

“Bit of both.”  

Nia rolled her eyes but nodded. “Great. If we die, I’m haunting you in increasingly inconvenient ways.”  

Then they followed.

⸻

We walked in quiet for a while. The maze narrowed. The air shimmered.  

“I was thinking,” I said finally, “you never told me how your date went.”  

Nia snorted. “We watched a horror movie that made *him* jump. I ate all the popcorn. He told me I was luminous and then fell asleep mid-sentence.”  

I blinked. “Wait—he fell asleep *during* the compliment?”  

“Deadass mid-word.”  

I couldn’t help it—I laughed. Loud. Echoing.  

The maze seemed to lean toward the sound. Like it was listening.  

“He’s cute,” she added a little too casually. “For a raccoon-hearted maniac with the moral compass of a cracked weathervane.”  

I smiled. “You like him.”  

“I like his dumplings,” she said, deadpan. Then: “…Maybe also his face.”  

We turned another corner.  

And I froze.  

There, in the center of a ring of stone pillars, stood an ancient tree—twisted, silver-barked, and blooming with flame-colored blossoms.  

The ring on my finger pulsed once.  

Not a warning.  

A memory.  

⸻

I stepped forward slowly.  

Rabbit hovered near the edge of the stone ring, clutching his snack like even *he* knew not to chew too loud.  
Nia crossed her arms, eyes scanning everything like she was waiting for a reason to fight the trees.  
Neither spoke.  
But their silence wasn’t empty.  
It was *intentional*.

The tree didn’t speak.  

But the ground beneath it shimmered—sigils carved into the stone, long worn, flaring faintly as I stepped into the circle.  

The air smelled of ash and violets.  

And in my head… something moved.  

A flicker.  
A scream.  
A girl burning—and *laughing* through the fire.  

I dropped to one knee.  

The mark on my back pulsed like a second heartbeat.  

And when I pressed my hand to the ground, the sigils *answered*.  

A whisper—not words. Not yet.  

But *familiar*.  

I wasn’t ready.  
But something in me already *was.*  

⸻

When I opened my eyes again, I was lying on my back.  

Nia hovered over me. “Feen? You okay?”  

I nodded slowly.  

Rabbit offered a water bottle. “You, uh… lit up like a glowstick for about twenty seconds. Thought about filming it, but figured that was bad vibes.”  

I took the water. My hands were shaking.  

“Did the tree do something?” Rabbit asked.  

“No,” I whispered. “I did.”  

Nia narrowed her eyes. “Define *‘did.’*”  

I looked back at the stone circle, now silent again.  

“I don’t know how I know,” I said slowly, “but I unlocked something. Not out here—*in me.* Like the tree just… responded. Like it remembered me. And I remembered *being part of this.*”  

Rabbit blinked. “You reincarnated as a Druid princess and forgot to mention?”  

I shook my head. “Not a princess. Something else. Something older.”  

Nia studied my face. “Do you feel different?”  

“Not stronger,” I said. “Just… less lost.”  

They helped me up.  

And together, we left the garden.  

The path sealed behind us.  

Like it had given me what it could.  
For now.
