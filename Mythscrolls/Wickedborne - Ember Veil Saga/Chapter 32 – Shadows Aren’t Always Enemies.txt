Chapter 32 – Shadows Aren’t Always Enemies  
POV: Cain Drossel  

⸻

I felt it before I saw her.  

A *shift.*  

The kind that settles between your ribs and makes your instincts sit up like a dog hearing a command in another language.  

She was walking toward the gym. Hood up. Shoulders squared.  

But something about her—  

She wasn’t just carrying herself.  
She was carrying *something else.*  

Power, maybe. Or truth. Or a memory she hadn't had yesterday.  

Whatever it was, it crackled.  

She walked through the doors like they owed her something.  

⸻

I was already in the ring, fists taped, sweat stinging my eyes.  

I didn’t stop.  

Not until her voice cut through the noise.  

“Didn’t know brooding counted as cardio.”  

I turned.  

And there she was.  

Hair a little tangled. Eyes bright like stormlight.  
The ring on her finger catching the overhead lights and throwing shadows where there should’ve been gleam.  

My heart did that stupid thing it didn’t *ask* permission for.  

“You disappeared,” I said.  

She shrugged. “Had to meet an ancient tree and scream at the dirt. Normal Tuesday.”  

I blinked. “What?”  

“Long story,” she said, hopping into the ring like it was hers. “But I’m here now.”  

I tossed her a set of gloves. “You sure you’re up for this?”  

She caught them without flinching. “Try me.”  

⸻

We circled.  

She wasn’t trained. But she was *intuitive.*  

Moved like someone who’d watched a thousand fights and absorbed the rhythm instead of the technique.  

Fast. Smart. Reactive.  

She got inside my guard on a feint and grinned like she’d just won the crown.  

“Beginner’s luck,” I muttered.  

“Or I’m just better,” she teased.  

I grunted, wiped sweat from my brow, and moved faster.  

And that’s when it happened—  

She blocked a hit, spun out—  
And *flared.*  

The air shimmered.  

The mark on my chest pulsed in answer.  

She froze.  

I stepped closer.  

“Did you feel that?” I asked.  

She nodded. “It’s happening more. Not just with you. The mark is… awake.”  

I swallowed hard. “Any idea what it wants?”  

She looked down at the gloves, then back at me.  

“No,” she said. “But it’s not afraid of you.”  

That shouldn’t have made me feel warm.  

But it did.  

⸻

After the session, we sat on the edge of the ring.  

She was quiet, drinking water, chewing on a piece of gum like it was her lifeline.  

I waited.  

Finally, she spoke.  

“There was a garden,” she said softly. “Old magic. Deep roots. I touched the ground and something… opened.”  

“You unlocked it?”  

“No,” she said, shaking her head. “I think I *remembered* how to ask.”  

I exhaled slow.  

“What did it give you?”  

She looked at me.  

And for a second, her face wasn’t just beautiful—it was *ancient.*  

Not in years.  

In knowing.  

“I think it gave me part of myself back.”  

⸻

We didn’t speak after that.  

Not because there wasn’t more to say.  
But because neither of us knew how to say it. Not yet.  

And when she leaned her head against my shoulder, I didn’t move.  

Not even an inch.  

Because for the first time in years—  

My ghosts stopped screaming.  

And *that* was enough.
