Chapter Thirty-Three – The Man Who Didn’t Wait  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The mark on my back flared the moment I stepped into the shop.

Not like before—not a burn or a hum. But a *pull*.

Like something had recognized me first.

⸻

The shop was stitched together with velvet shadows and smoke. Nothing had a price tag. Nothing had dust. Every item looked like it had been stolen from a forgotten god’s attic.

A clock ticked backwards.  
A compass spun wildly.  
A mirror turned its reflection toward the wall.

And at the center of it all—

A shadow-laced man with a silver smirk sat on the counter like he owned the space between moments.

He looked up, gaze hooking into mine like it had been waiting *years*.

“Hello, Seraphina.”

My name on his tongue made my skin itch.

“You are?”

He tilted his head, and the light caught on strands of silver in his dark hair. Not dyed. Not styled. Just—unreal.

“You can call me Luka.”

“Can I?”

His smile deepened. “You already do.”

⸻

He slid down from the counter, steps slow, like he was measuring gravity.

“Curious,” he murmured. “The ring chose well.”

My hand curled instinctively. “How do you know about the ring?”

He stopped a breath away from me. Not close enough to touch. But close enough that I could smell ink, wind, and something older.

“Because it remembers me,” he said. “And so do you.”

My breath hitched.

“I don’t—”

“Not yet,” he agreed.

Then he reached forward.

Not to touch me.  
But to press a single fingertip to the edge of the ring on my hand.

It flared.

Not with light—but with a low *thrumming*, like it was purring under my skin.

I yanked my hand back.

The ring didn’t stop.  
It *sang* under my skin—low and pulsing like a war drum in a sealed room.

My heart slammed against my ribs. My breath came shallow.  
And my chest—gods—it ached. Like something ancient had looked through me and *remembered me back*.

Luka just smiled.  
Like the pain was an answer.

⸻

“I have to go,” he said.

“You *just* got here.”

“I don’t stay where the world hasn’t caught up.”

He turned toward the back wall, which had absolutely no door.

But it opened.

Of course it did. Because why wouldn’t yet another mysterious door open by itself just because I happened to look at it too long?

“Sure,” I muttered. “Come right in, Seraphina. Don’t mind the horror movie vibes.”

And then he walked through it.

Like smoke.  
Like a lie.  
Like a truth I hadn’t earned yet.

“Seriously?” I muttered. “Do none of you people believe in normal exits?”

I paced once, then twice, before stopping dead center in the shop.

“Luka,” I whispered to no one. “What the hell are you?”

The silence didn’t answer.

But the air still felt like him.

And somewhere behind me, one of the backward clocks *stopped ticking*.  
A mirror cracked—silently.

Like the room itself wasn’t ready to let go of him either.

I hugged my arms around myself. Not because I was cold.  
But because something had shifted—again.

And the universe refused to explain the rules.

⸻

I stood alone in the shop that shouldn’t exist.

And the mark on my back?

It wasn’t just burning.

It was whispering his name.
