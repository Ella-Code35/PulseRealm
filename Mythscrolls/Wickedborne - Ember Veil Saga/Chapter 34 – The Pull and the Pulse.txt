Chapter 34 – The Pull and the Pulse  
POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I hadn’t planned to return to the shop.

Cain offered to come. Said he didn’t trust anyone whose name came wrapped in silence and shadows.

I almost said yes.

But something stopped me.  
Not mistrust. Not secrets. Just a feeling—like this was something I had to do *alone.*

Not because I trusted Luka.  
But because the pull in my chest wouldn’t let me do anything else.

Cain had asked why I didn’t want him there. I told him it wasn’t about trust.  
But truth?  
He didn’t like the way the air tasted when Luka said my name.  
Didn’t say it, but I saw it in his jaw.

⸻

The shop hadn’t changed.

Same crooked shelves. Same hum in the walls. Same air that tasted like old secrets and powdered silver.

But it *felt* different.

Like the walls were listening.

Luka stood exactly where I’d left him—behind the counter, polishing an orb that pulsed in time with the light. His eyes lifted the moment I stepped in.

“I wondered if you’d follow the pull.”

“I didn’t follow it,” I lied.

He smirked. “You *never* follow. You lead.”

“Then what am I doing here?”

Luka tilted his head. “Asking questions you already know the answers to.”

I crossed my arms. “Cryptic isn’t charming. It’s exhausting.”

“That’s what makes it fun.”

He gestured to the back room.

“Come. There’s something you need to see.”

I hesitated. Not because I was scared.  
But because something in me *wasn’t.*

⸻

The room beyond the beaded curtain was narrow and low-lit.

Stacks of old books, dried herbs strung like trophies from the ceiling, and a massive mirror in the corner. Cracked down the center. Veined like lightning.

Luka stood beside it, hands clasped behind his back.

“This mirror is older than the city,” he said. “Older than most things we still remember.”

I stared at it.  
The crack shimmered faintly. Like it had *bled* magic, once.

“And why do I need to see it?”

“Because it saw *you* first.”

⸻

I stepped closer.

My reflection didn’t mimic my movements.

It stood still while I tilted my head. Blinked when I didn’t. Smiled when my mouth stayed still.

It was me. And it *wasn’t.*

Luka didn’t explain.  
He didn’t need to.

Because deep in my chest—where the mark pulsed quiet and steady—I already knew:

Something about this mirror remembered me.

Not from this life.

From the ones I lost.

⸻

I turned to Luka. “What do you know?”

He studied me. Like he was weighing something far heavier than truth.

“I know you’ve burned before,” he said softly. “And I know you’ll burn again. But maybe this time, you won’t do it alone.”

My throat tightened.

He reached into his coat and pulled out a ring. Simple. Dark metal. Marked with an unfamiliar sigil.

“It’s not for now,” he said. “It’s for when the fire asks you to choose.”

He pressed it into my palm.

I felt it hum.

And deep in the mirror’s cracked face, my reflection smiled like it knew exactly what that meant.
