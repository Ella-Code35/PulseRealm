Chapter 35 – The Lantern Between Us

POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The streets were quieter than usual.

The kind of quiet that made your thoughts louder, heavier. That let shadows stretch a little farther, breathe a little deeper.

Cain wasn’t with me. But I had the distinct feeling he was near.

Watching from just around the corner. Pretending it was about safety, not worry. Not something deeper, softer.

I didn’t call him out for it.

Didn’t have to.

⸻

I reached Nia’s door and knocked twice, pausing like always before the third.

The door swung open mid-knock.

“Don’t you people believe in texting?” Nia grumbled.

Her hair was half pinned, half chaos. She had flour on her cheek and what looked like a rune-covered oven mitt in one hand.

I smiled. “Bad timing?”

“You’re just in time,” she said. “For chaos and cookies.”

She stepped aside, and I walked into the scent of cinnamon and molten sugar.

“Second date went that well?”

Nia rolled her eyes. “Define well. He didn’t spontaneously combust or try to barter me for snacks, so… progress?”

“Did he say where he was taking you?”

“Just said to wear shoes I could run in.”

“…Romantic.”

She tossed me a cookie. I caught it.

“He *is* weird,” she said. “But kind of… sweet, too? In a mildly alarming, probably-illegal way.”

“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but he might be *good* for you.”

She groaned. “You sound like my taxidermy aunt.”

“You don’t have a taxidermy aunt.”

“Exactly.”

⸻

We curled up on her cluttered couch, knees bumping, the warmth of the oven turning the apartment into something cozy, lived in. The kind of warmth that didn’t come from heat—but from *presence.*

“What about you?” Nia asked.

“Me?”

“You’ve been quiet lately. Broody. That’s *my* job.”

I hesitated.

Then, slowly, I told her about Luka. The mirror. The reflection that didn’t move when I did. The ring he gave me.

And the pull that hadn’t stopped since.

Nia listened.

Really listened.

Like she was collecting every word and storing it in a vault labeled *Important.*

She didn’t offer a solution. Didn’t make a joke.

Just nudged a mug toward me.

“Drink. You’re dehydrated and haunted.”

I took it.

The tea was spiced and strange, but it made the knots in my chest loosen a little.

“Thanks,” I said.

“For the tea?”

“For the *you.*”

Nia blinked. Then threw a blanket over my head.

The moment blurred—half laugh, half exhale.

She didn’t hug me.

But this? This was better.

⸻

Outside, the lanterns flickered to life, one by one, across the street.

And somewhere nearby, I could feel Cain’s presence shift.

Not closer.

But *settled.*

Like he knew I was safe here.

And maybe, for the first time since the marks began to burn, so did I.
