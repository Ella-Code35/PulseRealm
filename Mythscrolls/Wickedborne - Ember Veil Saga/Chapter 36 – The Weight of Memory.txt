Chapter 36 – The Weight of Memory

POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The streets were quieter than usual.

Not dead—just hushed. Like the city itself had paused, holding its breath while I walked.

Cain didn’t say he’d follow.

He didn’t have to.

I felt him before I saw him. Leaning against the old iron fence at the edge of the alley, arms crossed, coat caught in the wind like a second shadow.

“Subtle,” I said, not slowing.

He smirked. “Didn’t feel right letting you walk alone.”

I arched a brow. “Since when does that stop you?”

He hesitated—just enough to answer without words.

“Touché.”

⸻

We walked in silence for a while. Not the heavy kind. Just… quiet.

There was a market ahead. Lanterns swinging between the buildings like drunken stars. I paused under one, letting its soft light spill across my face.

Cain stopped beside me.

“I used to hate lanterns,” he said suddenly. “Back in the ring—before matches. They’d light these paper ones and float them above the arena. Like that made the blood more poetic.”

I looked at him.

“And now?”

He shrugged. “Now they just remind me I survived it.”

I didn’t say anything. Just stood beside him, watching the flickering glow sway.

Then, gently: “Magic ever do that to you?”

He tilted his head. “Do what?”

“Feel like it remembers something you don’t?”

Cain studied me for a long beat.

Then nodded. “Yeah. Magic’s funny like that.”

He glanced away, a small smile tugging at his mouth. “Last week, Rabbit tried to enchant a pair of gym gloves so they’d ‘train for him.’ Instead, they started slapping everyone who walked by.”

I blinked. “Please tell me you have a video.”

“Oh, I do. And I’m saving it for his wedding.”

I laughed—loud and sudden. The image of Rabbit dancing around a gym while the gloves randomly smacked people was too perfect.  
Cain looked over, and for a moment, the flicker of warmth in his eyes matched the lanterns above us.

The tension eased.

⸻

We moved on.

Past the lanterns. Past the stalls selling flame-glass trinkets and tea brewed with memory petals.

And finally, to the place I hadn’t meant to return.

The old stone gate. The pulse behind it.

I stopped.

Cain didn’t ask why.

He just waited.

I took a breath. Reached out. Let my hand hover just above the sigil etched into the stone.

And for a moment, something hummed beneath my skin. Not the ring. Not the mark.

Something older.

“Do you feel that?” I asked.

Cain didn’t answer. But his eyes were sharp. Watching. Alert.

I dropped my hand.

“Maybe we should come back tomorrow.”

“Maybe,” he said.

But we both knew we wouldn’t.
