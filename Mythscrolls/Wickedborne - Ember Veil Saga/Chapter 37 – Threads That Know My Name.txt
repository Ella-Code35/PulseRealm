Chapter 37 – Threads That Know My Name

POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

The path to the apartment felt longer than usual.

Not physically—but in the way time stretches when you’re carrying something unspoken.  
Cain kept pace beside me, hands in his coat pockets, eyes scanning shadows like they owed him something.

“You didn’t have to walk me back,” I said.

“I know.”

Silence.

Warm. Strangely easy.

⸻

Nia opened the door before I knocked.

“You’ve got a stalker,” she said by way of greeting.

Cain smirked behind me. “Exhibitionist, actually.”

She rolled her eyes. “Same level of jail time.”

I stepped in and kicked off my boots. Nia tossed me a drink with a flick of her wrist.  
Cain caught it instead.

“I was aiming for *her,* you fridge magnet.”

“Fridge magnet?” he echoed, amused.

“Unshakable and somehow always cold.”

“Touché.”

I sipped the drink. It tasted like night air and mint with a hint of starfruit—don’t ask, Nia’s drinks always had moods.  

Rabbit was on the couch, legs up, face buried in a throw pillow that looked suspiciously like a baked potato.

He looked up.

“Before you yell, I *knocked* this time.”

Cain raised a brow. “Define knock.”

“I kicked the door softly and whispered my hopes and dreams through the mail slot.”

“That explains the psychic echo I got,” Nia muttered.

“Also,” Rabbit added brightly, “I brought dessert.”

He pointed to the kitchen table.

It was empty.

“…You *ate* the dessert, didn’t you?” I said.

“Regretfully, yes.”

⸻

I curled into the corner of the couch as the others bickered in the background.

Something about Nia threatening to hex Rabbit’s eyebrows off if he touched her tea again.

Cain took the armchair. Watching. Always watching.

My hand drifted to the ring on my finger. Still quiet. Still warm. But it felt… expectant. Like it was waiting for something I hadn’t said yet.

A nudge, not a pull.

“What do you think it means?” I asked softly, turning the ring.

Cain leaned forward.

“Depends. What does *it* think *you* mean?”

That shouldn’t have made sense.

But it did.

And when I looked down again, the sigil on the ring shimmered once—like it *approved*.

I looked up, and Cain was still watching me.

Not like I was a mystery.

Like I was *familiar.*

Known.

“Stop looking at me like that,” I said, cheeks warming.

“Can’t,” he said.

Rabbit groaned from the couch. “Gods, just kiss already or commit to the mutual yearning.”

Nia threw a spoon at him.

I smiled.

And something inside me finally—*finally*—settled.

Not into place.

But into motion.
