Chapter 38 – Reflections of the Forgotten  
POV: Ezra Varnen  

⸻  

The sanctum hummed.  

Not with power—but with memory.  

The kind that clung to the walls like mist. The kind that whispered when you weren’t listening.  

I stood in the center of the circle, mirrors ringing me like sentinels. Some cracked. Some whole. All watching.  

I’d avoided this room for days. But now that Seraphina had awakened the mark... the mirrors had started reacting.  

And they didn’t react to just anyone.  

⸻  

Idris had been there when I arrived.  

He didn’t knock. He never did. Just *appeared*, like a thought you didn’t want to have.  

Tall, sharp, and dressed in layered black robes that moved like they weren’t made of fabric at all. A silver thread marked the hem—sigils stitched in a language even I couldn’t read.  

His eyes were mismatched—one amber, one pale grey—and his voice always felt like it came from behind you.  

He was one of us. A tether. But unlike the rest, Idris never tried to hide the monster in his blood.  

“You’re not the only one she’ll tether to,” he said, leaning against the stone arch like he belonged there.  

“You know that, right?”  

“I don’t care.”  

“Liar.”  

I didn’t answer.  

He let the silence stretch, then pushed off the wall and walked toward the exit.  

“She’ll need all of us eventually,” he said, without turning back. “Better hope you’re ready.”  

Then he vanished into the corridor, footsteps as quiet as regret.  

⸻  

I breathed in the quiet. Let it settle deep.  

The mirror directly across from me shimmered. A slow pulse. Like breath.  

Most people thought they were just mirrors.  
Reflections.  
Glass.  

But these weren’t made to show you what you *are.*  

They show you what you’ve *been.*  

What you’ve *forgotten.*  

And sometimes—if they liked you—they showed what you were too afraid to become.  

⸻  

I stared into the largest one. The one in the center. The one that cracked when she woke up.  

It didn’t show *me.*  

It showed *her.*  

Seraphina Vale.  

Eyes lit from within. Burn mark hidden beneath the collar. That mouth that spoke like fire, even when she whispered.  

And that *ring.*  

The cursed thing that linked us.  

She stood in the mirror like she *belonged* there.  

Like she remembered more than I did.  

⸻  

The door creaked.  

I turned.  

She was standing there.  

In *my* sanctum.  

“How did you—”  

“The door was open,” she said, then frowned. “No, actually. It wasn’t. But I’m here anyway.”  

Our eyes locked.  

This wasn’t a glimpse through enchanted glass. This was *real.*  

Tether to tether.  

Marked. Chosen. Bound.  

“Seraphina Vale,” she said after a moment. Voice steadier than I expected.  

“Ezra Varnen,” I replied. “So we finally meet properly.”  

Something flickered in her eyes—relief, maybe. Recognition.  

“I’ve seen you before,” she murmured.  

I nodded. “Reflections tend to cheat introductions.”  

A small smile touched her lips. “You’re… taller than I thought.”  

“You’re *louder,*” I said, and then regretted it instantly.  

But she laughed.  

Gods help me—she laughed.  

And the mirrors hummed in approval.  

⸻  

“I didn’t mean to interrupt,” she said, stepping closer. “I just… felt something.”  

“The mirrors react to tethers. That’s why they showed you.”  

She moved past me, gaze skimming over the old glass.  

“They’re not showing me now.”  

“They’re *watching* you now.”  

That made her pause. Then: “Creepy.”  

“Accurate.”  

⸻  

One of the mirrors shimmered again. The cracked one.  

She stepped toward it. I didn’t stop her.  

“Do you always keep them like this?” she asked.  

“They’re not mine to keep.”  

She glanced back at me, something unreadable in her eyes.  

“Then why do they listen to you?”  

I didn’t answer. Because I didn’t know.  

But the mirror cracked just a little more. And I saw something flash in its depths—  

A battlefield.  

A tower of light.  

A burning sigil carved into a broken sky.  

Her hand reached out—  

And the mirror pulsed.  

Once.  

Twice.  

Then stilled.  

She looked at me, and her voice was barely a whisper:  

“What *am* I?”  

I should’ve had an answer.  

Instead, I said, “That’s what we’re all trying to find out.”  

And the mirror—  

The oldest one—  

Smiled.
