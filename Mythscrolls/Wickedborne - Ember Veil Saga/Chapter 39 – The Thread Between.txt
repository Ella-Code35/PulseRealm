Chapter 39 – The Thread Between

POV: Seraphina Vale

⸻

I found Cain leaning against the alley wall like he hadn’t moved since I left.

“Didn’t peg you for the lurking type,” I said.

He shrugged. “Didn’t peg you for the wandering-into-ancient-shops-alone type.”

“Then you don’t know me very well.”

Cain smirked. “Learning fast.”

We started walking.

The streets were quieter than usual—just the flicker of lanternlight on damp stone and the occasional whisper of a passing spell.

“You always this smug after shadow-stalking someone to make sure they didn’t get hexed into oblivion?” I teased.

He tilted his head, amused. “Only when it works.”

“You think I need babysitting?”

“Not babysitting. Just…backup.”

I arched a brow. “You offering to be my sidekick?”

He chuckled. “Please. I’m the tragic antihero. You’re the unstable chosen one. Totally different dynamic.”

“That’s what you’re going with? Tragic?”

He gave me a side glance. “Brooding’s my cardio.”

I laughed—really laughed—and he looked almost startled by the sound.

“See?” he said. “Worth following you.”

I didn’t say anything to that.

Not because I didn’t want to.

Because maybe I did.

When we got back to the apartment, the door was slightly ajar.

Cain reached for the hilt of a knife that wasn’t there. I rolled my eyes and pushed it open.

Inside, chaos lived.

Nia was half-asleep on the couch, a half-eaten dumpling resting precariously on her chest.

Rabbit was at the other end—upside down, feet on the cushions, head hanging off the edge—singing softly to himself with a paper crown on his head and soy sauce on his shirt.

I paused in the doorway.

“What the hell happened here?”

“Victory,” Rabbit declared without sitting up.

Nia stirred. “He beat me at Boardwalk Betrayal. Twice.”

“She threw a cookie sheet at me,” he announced. “I deserved it. But still.”

“You let him win?” I asked, mock scandalized.

“I did not let him win,” she grumbled, grabbing the dumpling before it fell. “He cheated.”

“I don’t cheat,” Rabbit said. “I selectively bend probability.”

“You stole one dumpling,” Nia muttered, flipping a throw pillow at him.

“You don’t just steal dumplings,” Rabbit gasped dramatically, catching the pillow like a stage actor at death’s door. “They’re sacred. They’re—wait, what kind of filling was that? Mushroom? Or betrayal?”

“Spinach and you’re uninvited from leftovers.”

Cain glanced at me with the barest twitch of his lips. I just shook my head and headed toward the kitchen to make tea, trying not to smile too much.

Later, the four of us ended up around Nia’s tiny living room table.

A board game none of us understood became a battlefield of loud accusations and suspicious alliances.

Rabbit narrated every turn like it was a dramatic scene in a play—complete with impersonations. At one point, he did a flawless impression of Nia yelling at him about kitchen boundaries, while she tried to hide her laughter behind a mug.

Cain tried to pretend he wasn’t enjoying himself.

Tried. And failed.

I caught him watching me once, just before he rolled the dice. His eyes were softer than I’d ever seen them.

“You’re not playing to win,” I said quietly.

“No,” he replied. “Just playing to stay close.”

I didn’t answer.

Didn’t need to.

⸻

That night ended in spilled tea, fake curses, Rabbit swearing he’d never trust a cursed dice again, and Nia throwing a blanket at his head when he tried to sleep on the floor.

Laughter echoed between us, messy and real.

And later, when the others had drifted off and I was left staring at the ceiling, I realized something:

This—these strange, chaotic people—felt like the beginning of something I didn’t want to lose.
